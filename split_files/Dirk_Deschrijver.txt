Unit: Internet Technology and Data Science Lab (IDLab)
Bio: Dirk Deschrijverobtained in 2007 the PhD in Computer Science from the Dept. of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Antwerp, Belgium. In May-October 2005, he was a Marie Curie Fellow in the Scientific Computing group at the Eindhoven University of Technology in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. In 2006 and 2008, he was a visiting researcher at SINTEF Energy Research in Trondheim, Norway and the University of L’Aquila in Italy. From 2008-2014, he worked as an FWO post-doctoral research fellow in the IDLab research group in the Department of Information Technology at Ghent University. In 2012, he obtained a second PhD degree degree, in engineering, at Ghent University. Since October 2014, he has been working as a senior researcher at iMinds/imec. Since October 2016, he is as an associate professor in the IDLab research group of Ghent University, working on data analytics, machine learning and surrogate modeling algorithms.
