Bio: Aleksandra Pizurica(Dipl. Ing. Degree in Electrical Engineering (1994; the University of Novi Sad); Master of Science degree in Telecommunications (1997; the University of Belgrade); Ph.D. degree in Engineering (2002; Ghent University) is Professor in statistical image modelling at Ghent University. Prof. Pizurica is a Senior Area Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (2016 –), Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (2016 –), and served as an Associated Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (2012–2016). She received the Scientific Prize “de Boelpaepe” for 2013-2014, from the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium. Her research is in the area of statistical modelling, probabilistic graphical models and inference, sparse coding, signal/image processing and machine learning.
