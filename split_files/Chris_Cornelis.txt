Bio: Chris Cornelisobtained his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in computer science from Ghent University in 2000 and 2004, respectively. As a postdoctoral fellow, he was a beneficiary of an FWO postdoctoral mandate at UGent, a Ramón y Cajal contract at the University of Granada and an FWO Odysseus type II project at UGent. As of September 2023, he is a full-time professor in fuzziness and uncertainty modelling at the Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics.
