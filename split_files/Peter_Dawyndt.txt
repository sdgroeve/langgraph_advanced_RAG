Name: Peter Dawyndt
Unit: Computational Biology
Bio: Prof. Dr. Peter Dawyndtheads the Computational Biology Lab at the Faculty of Sciences (Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics), whose research occurs at the intersection of computer science and the life sciences. This cross-fertilization is a potential starting point for fundamental new developments in biology, biotechnology and medicine, but also serves as a source of inspiration for novel developments in computer science. Among the current research topics are computational applications for (meta)genomics, (meta)proteomics, (meta)transcriptomics, (bio)chemistry and data visualization. His group currently actively works on the development of theUnipept platformand theDodona platform.
