Name: Stijn Luca
Unit: BIOSTAT
Bio: Stijn Lucais Assistant professor at the Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling of the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering of Ghent University. He is head of the BIOSTAT research unit. His research activities are centered on the theory and methods of statistical data analysis. Recent work brought contributions to the fields of extreme value statistics, spatial statistics and statistical quality control.  He worked on a broad range of applications in the life sciences including species distribution modelling, study of citizen science data, industrial quality control and health monitoring (mhealth) among others.
