Name: Klaas Vandepoele
Unit: Comparative Network Biology (CNB)
Bio: Klaas Vandepoeleis Full Professor at Ghent University and group leader in the VIB-UGent Center for Plant Systems Biology. His aim is to extract biological knowledge from large-scale experimental data sets using data integration, comparative sequence/chromatin/expression analysis, and network biology. Through the development and application of various bioinformatics methods, he identifies new aspects of genome biology, especially in the area of gene function prediction, gene regulation and evolutionary/systems biology in plants, green algae and diatoms.
