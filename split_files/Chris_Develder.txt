Name: Chris Develder
Unit: Internet Technology and Data Science Lab (IDLab)
Bio: Chris Develderis associate professor with the research group IDLab in the Dept. of Information Technology (INTEC) at Ghent University - imec, Ghent, Belgium. He received the MSc degree in computer science engineering and a PhD in electrical engineering from Ghent University (Ghent, Belgium), in Jul. 1999 and Dec. 2003 respectively (as a fellow of FWO). He has stayed as a research visitor at UC Davis, CA, USA (Jul.-Oct. 2007) and at Columbia University, NY, USA (Jan. 2013 - Jun. 2015). Chris currently leads two research teams within IDLab, one on converting text to knowledge (i.e., NLP, mostly information extraction using machine learning), the other on data analytics and machine learning for smart grids. Chris and his team jointly have published more than 200 papers in international journals and conferences (e.g., EMNLP, CoNLL, EACL, ACL, ECIR, CIKM, WSDM, WWW, NIPS).
