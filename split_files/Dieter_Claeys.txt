Name: Dieter Claeys
Unit: Industrial Systems Engineering (ISyE)
Bio: Dieter Claeysis associate professor at the department of Industrial Systems Engineering at Ghent University, faculty of Engineering and Architecture. As a member of the Industrial Systems Engineering (ISyE) research group within that department, he is also active in Flanders Make, which is a strategic research center that supports the Flemish Make industry. He also is the UGent board member in the beta research school for operations management and logistics. 
Previously, he was a research assistant and FWO postdoctoral research assistant at the department of Telecommunications and Information processing at Ghent University. In 2013, he was a visiting researcher at Eurandom, Technical university Eindhoven. His research is focused on the performance analysis and control of manufacturing systems with particular attention to uncertainties that occur in these systems.
