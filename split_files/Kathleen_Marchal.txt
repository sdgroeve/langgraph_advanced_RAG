Name: Kathleen Marchal
Unit: Data integration and biological networks (DBN)
Bio: Kathleen Marchalis Professor at the Dept. of Plant Biotechnology & Bioinformatics and at the Dept. of Information Technology, (IDLab, IMEC) at Ghent University. She has publishedover 160 reviewed journal publications (SCI h-index: 34)and supervised more than 20 Ph.D. students. Her lab focuses on developing computational methods for the analysis, integration and interpretation of systems biology and systems genetics data. The group is internationally recognized for network-based integrative genotype-phenotype mapping in the context of precision oncology. The group is member of the Movember Global Action Plan 6 project, focusing on oligometastatic prostate cancer and of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC)-PAWG network analysis group. K. Marchal is member of the Ghent Bioinformatics Institute and of the Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG). Her group closely works with clinicians and is involved and coordinating several larger initiatives at Ghent university to set up genome driven precision oncology at UZ Ghent and UZ Antwerp.
