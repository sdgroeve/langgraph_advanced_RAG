Name: Arnout Van Messem
Unit: TWiSt
Bio: Arnout Van Messemgraduated in 2000 from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel as licentiate Mathematics. After his studies, he worked for five years as an actuary and in the meantime obtained his degree in Actuarial Sciences in 2002 at the same university. In 2011 he also obtained his Ph.D. on robustness and consistency properties of Support Vector Machines.After a number of postdoctoral positions (KU Leuven, Ghent University) and visiting professor mandates (10% Hasselt University, 90% Ghent University), he was in August 2015 appointed as statistics professor at the Ghent University Global Campus (GUGC) in South Korea. He is also affiliated to the Department of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Statistics at Ghent University. At GUGC, he is responsible for a number of mathematical and statistical courses. As a member of the Center for Biotech Data Science, he performs research on the application of machine learning techniques for biotech data.
