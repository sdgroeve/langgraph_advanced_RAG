Name: Wilfried Philips
Unit: Image Processing and Interpretation (IPI)
Bio: Wilfried Philipsis a senior full professor at Ghent University and scientific lead of imec’s newly formed Center of Excellence on Image Processing and Sensor Fusion. He leads imec-UGent’s research Image on Processing and Interpretation (IPI) and UGent’s valorization consortium iKnow, which focus on applications of big data science and has created 9 spin off companies. He is co-founder of Senso2Me, a company which provides Internet of Things services for elderly care. He is senior member of IEEE and fellow of the Belgian-American Educational Foundation.Wilfried Philips’s research interests relate to image real-time computer vision and video quality improvement, with a strong focus on industrial applications. IPI’s research in this area has led to three spin off companies.
