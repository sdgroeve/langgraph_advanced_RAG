Name: Peter Lambert
Unit: Internet Technology and Data Science Lab (IDLab)
Bio: Peter Lambertis a full-time Associate Professor at the Internet Technology and Data Science Lab (IDLab) of Ghent University – imec (Belgium) since 2013, where he coordinates the research team “MEDIA”. He received his Master’s degree in science (mathematics) and in applied informatics from Ghent University in 2001 and 2002, respectively, and he obtained the Ph.D. degree in computer science in 2007 at the same university. Between 2010 and 2013, he was a Technology Developer at Ghent University. His research interests include multimedia signal processing, visual communication, computer graphics, and AR/VR.
