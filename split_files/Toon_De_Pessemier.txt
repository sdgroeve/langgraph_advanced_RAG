Bio: Toon De Pessemierstudied at Ghent University where he received the MSc degree in computer science engineering in 2006. That same year, he joined the WiCa research group of Ghent University (now known as WAVES). From 2007 to 2011, he was a Ph.D. student of the Research Foundation—Flanders (FWO).In 2013, he obtained a PhD on his research topic “improved online services by personalized recommendations and optimal quality of experience parameters”. In 2015, he obtained a BOF scholarship at Ghent University. The title of his research work is “Design and validation of innovative techniques to assist people in the decision making process by analyzing data of user behavior and contextual features”. His current research interests include recommender systems and personalization in general with specific focuses on context-aware, real-time, and group recommendations as well as the combination of human intelligence and recommendation algorithms. Last years, he applied the knowledge of machine learning to the domain of industry 4.0, more specifically for scheduling and machine failure prediction.
