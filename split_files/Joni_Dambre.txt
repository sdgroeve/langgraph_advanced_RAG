Bio: Joni Dambrehas a MSc in Electrical Engineering and a PhD in Computer Science Engineering from Ghent University. After doing PhD and postdoc research in topics related to digital hardware (circuits design, design automation), she made a successful career shift towards machine learning and neural networks in 2008, obtaining a 10% professorship (UGent). In 2013, she became a full-time tenured professor (hoofddocent). Her research group (now called AIRO) covers a broad spectrum of interconnected topics related to machine learning, deep learning and embedded implementations thereof, robotics and brain-inspired unconventional computing.  Under her lead, the team combines foundational and applied research. A thorough hands-on applied knowledge is being maintained through the teamâ€™s  successful track record in Kaggle competitions
