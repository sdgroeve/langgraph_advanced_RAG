Bio: Bruno Volckaert(male) is professor advanced programming and software engineering in the Department of Information Technology (INTEC) at Ghent University and senior researcher at imec. He obtained his Master of Computer Science degree in 2001 from Ghent University, after which he worked on his PhD at Ghent University on data intensive scheduling and service management for Grid computing, which he obtained in 2006. His current research deals with reliable and high performance distributed cloud-based backend systems for Smart Cities and industry4.0, distributed decision support systems, autonomous optimization of cloud-based applications and cybersecurity by means of machine learning. He has worked on over 40 national and international research projects and is author or co-author of more than 100 papers published in international journals and conference proceedings.
