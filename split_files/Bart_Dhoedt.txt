Name: Bart Dhoedt
Unit: Internet Technology and Data Science Lab (IDLab)
Bio: Bart Dhoedtreceived a Masters degree in Electro-technical Engineering (1990) from Ghent University. His research, addressing the use of micro-optics to realize parallel free space optical interconnects, resulted in a Ph.D. degree in 1995. After a 2-year post-doc in opto-electronics, he became Professor at the Department of Information Technology.Bart Dhoedt is responsible for various courses on algorithms, advanced programming, software development and distributed systems. His research interests include distributed machine learning, edge computing and hardware friendly machine learning. He is author or co-author of more than 300 publications in international journals or conference proceedings.
