Name: Vanessa Vermeirssen
Unit: Laboratory for Computational Biology, Integromics and Gene Regulation (CBIGR)
Bio: Vanessa Vermeirssengraduated from Ghent University with a Master of Science and a PhD in Bioscience Engineering. After conducting postdoctoral training in functional genomics, systems biology, bioinformatics and computational biology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, the Center of Plant Systems Biology of VIB, and the Center for Medical Genetics Ghent, she obtained a research professorship (BOF-ZAP) in integromics at Ghent University. She is principal investigator of the Laboratory for Computational Biology, Integromics and Gene Regulation (CBIGR) and group leader at the Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG). She has internationally recognized expertise in systems biology and bioinformatics, more specifically in gene regulatory networks, regulatory genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, network inference and omics data integration. The CBIGR lab aims to unravel mechanisms of complex diseases by acquiring a functional understanding of gene regulation and signaling towards personalized medicine, using bioinformatics, statistics and machine learning, as well as high-throughput biological approaches in the omics field.
