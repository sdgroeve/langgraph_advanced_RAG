Bio: Guy De Tréis Associate professor at the Department of Telecommunications and Information Processing of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture of Ghent University. He is head of the Database, Document, and Content Management (DDCM) research group. His research activities are centred on computational intelligence in information management systems, including fundamental research on bipolarity handling, uncertainty handling, multi-valued logics and spatio-temporal modelling and applied research on, among others, big data (NoSQL databases), fuzzy querying, decision support, data quality, and unstructured data.
