Bio: Joris Degrootereceived the MSc and PhD degrees in Electromechanical Engineering from Ghent University in 2006 and 2010, respectively. During 2007–2008, he stayed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in 2011 at Technische Universität München. He obtained a post-doctoral fellowship of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) and became Associate Professor at the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture of Ghent University in 2013. Since September 2020, he is a full professor at Ghent University. He is also a core lab member of Flanders Make as well as member of scientific and editorial boards of conferences and journals. He focuses on the development of techniques for the simulation of fluid-structure interaction and their application in various fields. This research involves parameter identification and optimization using gradient-based and surrogate-based techniques, also under uncertainty, reduced order models and machine learning.
