Name: Peter Bienstman
Unit: Photonic Neuromorphic Computing (Photonics)
Bio: Peter Bienstmanwas born in Ghent, Belgium, in 1974. He received a degree in electrical engineering from Ghent University, Belgium, in 1997 and a Ph.D. from the same university in 2001, at the Department of Information Technology (INTEC), where he is currently a full professor. His research interests include several applications of nanophotonics (biosensors, photonic information processing, …) as well as nanophotonics modelling. He has published over 110 papers and holds several patents. He has been awarded a ERC starting grant for the Naresco-project: Novel paradigms for massively parallel nanophotonic information processing.
