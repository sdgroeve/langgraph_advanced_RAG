Name: Sofie Van Hoecke
Unit: Internet Technology and Data Science Lab (IDLab)
Bio: Sofie Van Hoeckegraduated from the Engineering Department from the Ghent University in 2003. Following up on her studies in computer science, she achieved a PhD in computer science engineering at the Department of Information Technology at the same university on Efficient service management in healthcare. After being a postdoctoral research engineer at the Department of Information Technology, she started as lecturer ICT and ICT research coordinator at the University College West-Flanders. Currently, she is associate professor at Ghent University, IDLab - Data Science Lab. Her specialties are: multi-sensor and service oriented architectures, novel services, condition monitoring, emotion recognition, machine learning, semantic dashboards, and the fusion of machine learning and semantic technologies, applied in both predictive maintenance and predictive healthcare.LinkedIn
Keywords: hybrid modelling, fusion of machine learning and semantics, fusion of machine learning and physical modelling, dynamic dashboards, expert-driven machine learning
