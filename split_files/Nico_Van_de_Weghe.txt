Bio: Prof. dr. Nico Van de Wegheis a full professor of GIScience, a scientific discipline at the intersection of computer science, social science, and natural science. GIScience involves the study of geospatial information and how people understand the world. It also addresses how phenomena of the world can be stored, represented, and analyzed. It lies at the basis of GeoAI, which is the goal of enabling machines to learn to reason and analyse spatially like a human. Since his PhD research in 2004, Van de Weghe has had a broad interest in knowledge-based AI, specifically spatiotemporal reasoning and analysis.As in all areas related to AI, data-driven approaches are becoming increasingly dominant in GeoAI. Therefore, Van de Weghe is currently focusing on research in both knowledge-based and data-driven GeoAI. He is exploring the possibilities of combining both into hybrid GeoAI. Van de Weghe’s emphasis since his early research days has been on spatiotemporal applications in general and the analysis of moving objects more specifically. He has applied his research in a variety of domains, including animal behavior, criminology, crowd analysis, healthcare, mobility research, navigation, and sports analysis.
