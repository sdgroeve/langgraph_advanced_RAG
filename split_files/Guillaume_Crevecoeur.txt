Bio: Guillaume Crevecoeur(1981) received the MSc and the PhD degree in Engineering Physics from Ghent University in 2004 and 2009, respectively. In 2004 he joined the Department of Electrical Energy, Metals, Mechanical Constructions, and Systems as doctoral student and in 2009 he became a postdoctoral fellow of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO-Flanders).  In the winter 2011 he was a visiting researcher at the Technical University Ilmenau and the Physikalische Technische Bundesanstalt, Berlin, Germany. In 2014 he was appointed Associate Professor at the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture of Ghent University. He is furthermore an affiliate member of Flanders Make, the strategic research center for the manufacturing industry, and member within international scientific steering committees. His research interests are the modelling, optimization and control of dynamical systems including foundational work on model-based optimization algorithms, inverse problems and nonlinear optimal control with on-going strategic research on machines and motion systems.
