Name: Sarah Verhulst
Unit: wireless, acoustics, environment & expert systems (WAVES)
Bio: Prof. Dr. Verhulstis Associate Professor in Hearing Technology at the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, and joined Ghent University in 2016 after PhD and post- doctoral training at the Technical University of Denmark, Boston University and Harvard Medical school. Her lab consists of 6 members working interdisciplinary (combining EEG, sound perception, machine learning and computational neuroscience) on the topics of machine hearing and advanced (AI-based) hearing diagnostics and restoration methods. She has organized the international auditory modeling and speech-in-noise workshops, is a technical committee member of the acoustical society of America and received the 2016 Niedersachsen Wissenschaftspreis (Kat.II) as well as the 2018 Advances and Perspectives in Auditory Neuroscience (APAN) Young Investigator Spotlight Prize.
