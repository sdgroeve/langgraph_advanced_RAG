Name: Jan Fostier
Unit: Internet Technology and Data Science Lab (IDLab)
Bio: The research group ofJan Fostierhas a strong background in both High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data Analytics with applications in life sciences and bioinformatics. By exploiting the computing power of supercomputers and/or accelerator technology (GPUs), it is often possible to reduce runtime by two or three orders of magnitude. Even though primarily focused on the computing aspects, our research group is involved in many interdisciplinary scientific collaborations, often cross-faculty/university (bioscience engineers, biologist, medical doctors, etc.) and/or with industry (Janssen Pharmaceutica,  Progeno, Amplidata, Enza Zaden, Agilent, Bluebee, etc.).
Keywords: Bioinformatics, sequencing data, high performance computing (HPC), big data processing, stochastic modelling
