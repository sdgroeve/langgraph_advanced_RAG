Name: Haosheng Huang
Unit: CartoGIS
Bio: Prof. dr. Haosheng Huangstarts a tenure track professorship in GIScience and Cartography since February 2020. He obtained a BSs/MSc degree (2006, with distinction) in Computer Science and a PhD degree (2013, with distinction) in Geoinformation/Cartography. Previously, he was a senior lecturer and research group leader at the Department of Geography at the University of Zurich, Switzerland (2016-2020); a researcher and lecturer (Univ.Ass.Dr.techn.) at Research Group Cartography, TU Wien, Austria (2013-2016).Haosheng has a broad research interest in the modelling, analysis, and visualization of geographical data, as well as their interdisciplinary applications. His research expertise includes: Geospatial data science and GeoAI, Urban informatics, Location based services and mobile HCI (e.g., augmented reality AR), and Spatial cognition (e.g., with eye-tracking and EEG). The application domains range from navigation systems (for pedestrians, cyclists, and car drivers), sustainable mobility, and smart cities to social equity and health sciences.
