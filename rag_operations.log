Research Focus: The research aims at the development of computational tools for precision medicine, where drug molecules are engineered to the patients’ genetic code, by modeling the protein-drug complexes at the atomic scale. In many cancer therapies, a drug molecule has to be delivered to a toxic target protein, where binding of this drug to a specific binding site enables the desired therapeutic effect. Patients with genetic mutations can express modified protein sequences, where the substition of one amino acid can already result in diminished drug binding, or even no binding at all.The goal of our research is to chart drug compatibility with differently mutated target proteins, using specialized molecular dynamics simulations. Particular focus is set on kinetic profiling of protein-drug complexes, where knowledge of time-dependent parameters (i.e. drug residence time, rate constants, etc.) enables better prediction of the drug’s in vivo efficacy.

2024-12-03 15:40:53,247 - RAGLogger - INFO - Research Focus: The research aims at the development of computational tools for precision medicine, where drug molecules are engineered to the patients’ genetic code, by modeling the protein-drug complexes at the atomic scale. In many cancer therapies, a drug molecule has to be delivered to a toxic target protein, where binding of this drug to a specific binding site enables the desired therapeutic effect. Patients with genetic mutations can express modified protein sequences, where the substition of one amino acid can already result in diminished drug binding, or even no binding at all.The goal of our research is to chart drug compatibility with differently mutated target proteins, using specialized molecular dynamics simulations. Particular focus is set on kinetic profiling of protein-drug complexes, where knowledge of time-dependent parameters (i.e. drug residence time, rate constants, etc.) enables better prediction of the drug’s in vivo efficacy.

Research Focus: My research focuses on developing and implementing computational tools to understand the mechanisms and transport characteristics of permeants such as small molecules or peptide-like drugs through membranes and transporters. These computational tools rely on Molecular Dynamics, a powerful method for calculating parameters such as binding energy, residence time, and rate constants. This deeper comprehension of protein-drug kinetics at this detailed scale, which may not be achievable in experimental setups, can significantly enhance our ability to predict the efficacy of drugs in cancer treatment.

RESEARCH INFORMATION:
====================
Keywords: peptide synthesis, oligonucleotide synthesis, protein modification, protein-DNA conjugates, click reactions, furan, photoactivity probes, Cyclolipodepsipeptides
Research Focus: The Organic and Biomimetic Chemistry Research (OBCR) Group is specialized in the design and synthesis of modified peptides and nucleic acids and methods for their conjugation and labeling. Building expertise in this area for more than 20 years, within OBCR we now try to contribute to tackling the major challenge of targeted delivery of next-generation therapeutic biologicals where successful orthogonal bioconjugation chemistries are prerequisite for the success of such therapeutic strategies. In parallel, we exploit the developed technologies for applications in advanced biomarker detection. We use tools such as singlet oxygen (or ROS species on cellular level) and red light activation of photosensitizers to achieve selective precision ligations and bioconjugations between and/or to biomolecules.More specifically, major research interests include:The construction of conformationally defined peptide architectures. Scaffold decoration, cyclisation and peptide stapling are used to impose a particular conformation and stability on the parent peptides. The synthesized compounds can find applications as peptide vaccins, peptide hydrogels, protein mimetics, DNA-binding ligands and artificial receptors or synthetic antibodies.The development of new methods for crosslinking and labeling of biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins and oligonucleotides. More specifically the OBCR group has developed a versatile furan-oxidation based bioconjugation method for the site-selective labeling or introduction of covalent bonds between two binding partners.The design of novel reactive ‘clickable’ peptide and oligonucleotide based probes, including peptide nucleic acids, for applications in antisense and antigene strategies, protein and miRNA/lncRNA target identification and receptor pulldown.

Description: Doctoral fellow – IBiTech-BioMMedA research group, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture - UGent Principal investigator: prof. An Ghysels (PhD) Doctoral fellow – Bio2Byte, Interuniversity Institute of Bioinformatics in Brussels - Vrije Universiteit Brussel

RESEARCH INFORMATION:
====================
Keywords: Precision medicine, molecular dynamics, protein-ligand binding, glycosylation, bioinformatics, computational drug design
Research Focus: Protein-drug interactions are crucial in precision medicine in cancer. However, a number of complex factors such as acquired drug resistance, drug efficacy, mutation in oncoproteins, drug toxicity, lower protein-drug binding affinity have attributed to the failures of various computational tools that are focused on protein-drug interactions in cancer.The standard methods in protein-drug interactions involve rigid-body docking of protein-ligand(s) (an ion, small-molecule drugs, conserved water molecules). In addition, they do not address the dynamic and conformational behaviour of proteins and ligands which can be affected by mutations, post-translational modifications such as glycosylation further affecting their binding affinity. Therefore, for the accurate diagnosis, monitoring and treatment in cancer there is a need to develop accurate biophysical fingerprints of protein-drug interactions that correspond with sequence variants, molecular dynamics of protein-ligand, post-translational modifications as well as drug pharmacodynamics.The main objective of the research project is the development of new methodological and computational solutions implemented as a freely available web-based atlas for prediction of response to drugs through prediction of binding sites and their ligands, and prediction of the effects of sequence variants on binding affinity and dynamics for drug molecules enabling inferences in drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.

RESEARCH INFORMATION:
====================
Keywords: Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy, FLIM, organoids, metabolism, machine learning
Research Focus: Intestinal organoids derived from stem cells serve as powerful in vitro models containing multiple cell types that replicate tissue architecture and function. While metabolism's established role in energy production is well understood, its emerging function as a developmental regulator remains poorly characterized, particularly regarding cell-specific metabolic dynamics. Current methods for studying single-cell metabolism require sample fixation or disrupt the native cellular environment, limiting continuous analysis. We address this gap by developing a novel live imaging method integrating Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) with machine learning. Using fluorescent tracers for selective cell labeling, validated through immunofluorescence and single-cell sequencing, we perform metabolic profiling via FLIM imaging of mitochondrial potential and endogenous metabolic markers and analyze glucose metabolism in crypt regions. Through development of an automated analysis pipeline for tracking specific cell populations, this approach enables comprehensive single-cell metabolic analysis in living intestinal organoids.

RESEARCH INFORMATION:
====================
Keywords: molecular modeling, modelling and simulation, Kinetics
Research Focus: My research focuses on developing and implementing computational tools to understand the mechanisms and transport characteristics of permeants such as small molecules or peptide-like drugs through membranes and transporters. These computational tools rely on Molecular Dynamics, a powerful method for calculating parameters such as binding energy, residence time, and rate constants. This deeper comprehension of protein-drug kinetics at this detailed scale, which may not be achievable in experimental setups, can significantly enhance our ability to predict the efficacy of drugs in cancer treatment.

RESEARCH INFORMATION:
====================
Keywords: peptide synthesis, oligonucleotide synthesis, protein modification, protein-DNA conjugates, click reactions, furan, photoactivity probes, Cyclolipodepsipeptides
Research Focus: The Organic and Biomimetic Chemistry Research (OBCR) Group is specialized in the design and synthesis of modified peptides and nucleic acids and methods for their conjugation and labeling. Building expertise in this area for more than 20 years, within OBCR we now try to contribute to tackling the major challenge of targeted delivery of next-generation therapeutic biologicals where successful orthogonal bioconjugation chemistries are prerequisite for the success of such therapeutic strategies. In parallel, we exploit the developed technologies for applications in advanced biomarker detection. We use tools such as singlet oxygen (or ROS species on cellular level) and red light activation of photosensitizers to achieve selective precision ligations and bioconjugations between and/or to biomolecules.More specifically, major research interests include:The construction of conformationally defined peptide architectures. Scaffold decoration, cyclisation and peptide stapling are used to impose a particular conformation and stability on the parent peptides. The synthesized compounds can find applications as peptide vaccins, peptide hydrogels, protein mimetics, DNA-binding ligands and artificial receptors or synthetic antibodies.The development of new methods for crosslinking and labeling of biomacromolecules such as peptides, proteins and oligonucleotides. More specifically the OBCR group has developed a versatile furan-oxidation based bioconjugation method for the site-selective labeling or introduction of covalent bonds between two binding partners.The design of novel reactive ‘clickable’ peptide and oligonucleotide based probes, including peptide nucleic acids, for applications in antisense and antigene strategies, protein and miRNA/lncRNA target identification and receptor pulldown.

RESEARCH INFORMATION:
====================
Keywords: Precision medicine, molecular dynamics, protein-ligand binding, glycosylation, bioinformatics, computational drug design
Research Focus: Protein-drug interactions are crucial in precision medicine in cancer. However, a number of complex factors such as acquired drug resistance, drug efficacy, mutation in oncoproteins, drug toxicity, lower protein-drug binding affinity have attributed to the failures of various computational tools that are focused on protein-drug interactions in cancer.The standard methods in protein-drug interactions involve rigid-body docking of protein-ligand(s) (an ion, small-molecule drugs, conserved water molecules). In addition, they do not address the dynamic and conformational behaviour of proteins and ligands which can be affected by mutations, post-translational modifications such as glycosylation further affecting their binding affinity. Therefore, for the accurate diagnosis, monitoring and treatment in cancer there is a need to develop accurate biophysical fingerprints of protein-drug interactions that correspond with sequence variants, molecular dynamics of protein-ligand, post-translational modifications as well as drug pharmacodynamics.The main objective of the research project is the development of new methodological and computational solutions implemented as a freely available web-based atlas for prediction of response to drugs through prediction of binding sites and their ligands, and prediction of the effects of sequence variants on binding affinity and dynamics for drug molecules enabling inferences in drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.

RESEARCH INFORMATION:

Keywords: cost-effectiveness, sustainability, health economics, public health, holistic assessment, health technology assessment
Research Focus: Our research explores various aspects of chronic disease management, with a focus on the cost-effectiveness and holistic sustainability assessments of prevention, screening, and treatment strategies related o.a. to cancer. By developing a holistic sustainability assessment, we aim to address a critical gap in health technology assessment (HTA). Traditionally, HTA has concentrated primarily on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, often overlooking the broader societal and environmental impacts of healthcare interventions.Our multidisciplinary approach seeks to integrate economic, social, and environmental dimensions into a comprehensive assessment framework. This framework provides a more nuanced evaluation of healthcare interventions—one that not only considers health outcomes and financial costs but also assesses their environmental and societal impacts.To achieve this, we combine public health and health economic methodologies with life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques, encompassing the entire patient pathway. This approach aims to foster a more sustainable healthcare system, better equipped to address the long-term challenges posed by chronic diseases. Ultimately, our work could lead to more informed policy decisions, optimizing resource allocation while minimizing the ecological footprint of healthcare interventions.
