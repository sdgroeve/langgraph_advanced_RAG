As social robots become increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life, from healthcare and education to companionship and customer service, there is a need for more sophisticated and empathetic AI systems. Our studies focus on creating AI models that can understand and respond to human emotions, behaviours, and social cues, thereby enabling social robots to interact more naturally and meaningfully with humans.\nBy leveraging machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, we will develop and refine algorithms that allow social robots to engage in dynamic, context-aware interactions. This includes the ability to adapt to individual user preferences, provide personalised assistance, and foster positive emotional connections. Additionally, we will investigate the ethical implications and societal impacts of deploying advanced AI in social robots, ensuring that our innovations align with ethical standards and contribute positively to human well-being.\nOur interdisciplinary approach will involve collaboration with experts in AI, robotics, psychology, and ethics, aiming to push the boundaries of what is possible in HRI. The outcomes of this research have the potential to revolutionize the field of social robotics, offering profound benefits in enhancing the quality of life and improving the efficiency of services across various sectors.",

However, these systems still have significant weaknesses that temper the excitement, including opaque reasoning behind their outputs, fabricating unsupported information, and ethical concerns around bias, misuse, and their effects on society. Rolling out these models in real-life applications, where unpredictable or incorrect output is unacceptable, requires the study of ways to have fine-grained control over what these models generate. The best-performing models are generally closed source and their usage is often a paid service, while privacy of user data is not guaranteed and the model\u2019s architecture and weights are not known \u2014 so access might be lost at any time. Therefore, this research project focuses on improving local models. In applications where precision rather than creativity is important and where ownership of the model cannot be trusted to overseas corporations, there is a pressing need for models over which the application builder has control. This research project tries to solve this by applying, combining and building methods to gain control over generative AI models, to use them in a safe and trustworthy manner. The project evaluates the generative models in a second language tutoring application using social robots, an ambitious use case which stress tests generative AI in real-world environment.",

Nonverbal behaviour refers to the use of gestures, body language and facial expressions which we use when interacting with others. Nonverbal behaviour is said to make up 55% of our communication, and when it is lacking, wrong or ill-timed it can seriously hinder communication. Social robots are robots that interact with us using the same communication channels as people use. As such they also need to express appropriate nonverbal behaviour. If a robot\u2019s nonverbal behaviour is optimised, we expect the interaction between people and robots not only to be more pleasant, but also to be more effective. In this project, instead of programming nonverbal behaviour, we let the robot learn its nonverbal behaviour by letting it watch people talk and interact. As nonverbal behaviour is coordinated with verbal behaviour, we will learn the relationship between both by using state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks. To teach the robot, we show it video clips of people talking at TEDx events and of people engaged in a conversation, for which we work together with the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. Once the networks are trained, we will assess the performance of the robot by running a series of studies in which we measure how effective the robot is at getting a message across and how persuasive the robot is.",

Indeed, Caphe was originally developed to facilitate simulations of photonic reservoir computing, i.e. study the behaviour of very large nonlinear dynamical circuits. At the start of the ERRC StG and even today, no other product existed which had the combination of flexibility and performance to help us perform that research. Therefore we developed out own tool, incorporating novel ideas to speed up the simulations for these large-scale networks. When new users whithin our own research group started using Caphe outside the field of photonic reservoir computing, it gradually became clear that this tool could have a more universal appeal and it would therefore be valuable to commercialise it. In summary the ERC StG will focus on using the existing version of Caphe to generate new scientific results in photonic computing, whereeas the PoC will focus on extending the software to bring it to commercialisiation in fields outside of photonic reservoir computing.",

It is beyond any doubt that there is a clear need for this, as evidenced by the large consortium: 13 promotors spanning 8 research units and 4 departments working in very different fields, including promotors both from UGent and from Hogeschool Gent. In addition, such a large consortium also guarantees optimal usage of the equipment. Also, the versatility of the requested equipment enables or facilitates new collaborations inside this consortium. E.g., there have already been many interactions between INTEC_design, photonics, the field of EMC and EM simulations, analog circuits and systems (CAS) and advanced modulation, equalization and coding (DIGCOM).

Instruments on the market are large and expensive, resulting in long queuing times and preventing its widespread use in hematology and in clinical routine diagnosis. Obstacles that prevent cytometry miniaturisation are: 1) the costly and tendious assembly of optical components and 2) the lack of solutions for fast fluidic cell sorting. In a previous project, we have proposed an innovative high throughput approach towards cytometry. We combine lensfree - i.e. holographic - digital imaging of cells on a high speeds CMOS active optical pixel matrix integrated with a highly parallelised microfluidic backbone that steers cell towards different outlets using ultrafast thermal bubble actuation. Lensfree cell sorters can be realized in a cheap and compact platform, as all optomechanical components are replaced by nanoelectronics, advanced imaging and signal processing technology. The achievable throughput will depend on the efficient implementation of cell classification, hence this project is focussing as well on neuro-evolutionary algorithms and reservoir computing based principles to increase the accuracy of the system. We will thereby enable high throughput sorting starting from millimeters of whole blood in a few minutes with many applications in life sciences and clinical diagnostics of diseases at the single cell level.",

Although fabricated by the same infrastructure as digital chips, it will handle optical instead of electronic signals. Similar to its biological counterpart, it will consist of \u2018neurons\u2019, sending out pulses to each other. Information in such networks is represented in the pulse-timing.I will show that this system is able to solve non-trivial tasks in which, e.g., many time-varying input signals have to be processed simultaneously. Similarly to our brain, which faces an equivalent computational challenge every day, it will do this in an energy-efficient way. By processing optical signals instead of electrical ones, it will also be faster than electronic solutions. Indeed, as illustrated by the recent development of optical interconnections to increase the information transfer in future generation digital chips, the transfer of large amounts of information can happen at higher speeds and using less power. Additionally, optical phenomena have much richer intrinsic dynamics, making it easier to mimic neural behaviour.During my PhD research, I have studied a class of tiny optical components that indeed behave phenomenologically identical to biological neurons. I will now integrate them into a larger network, and incorporate an electronic layer on top of the optical layer that will allow the system to learn from examples.",

Doped semiconductors undergo an interesting transition from the size-quantization regime to the classical regime of plasmon oscillations. This transition region can exhibit strong nonlocal and nonlinear optical response due to a large variety of electron-electron interactions. The decrease in electron density induced on the semiconductor surface by an external bias can be used to modulate the nonlinear response strength. This unprecedented feature will be used to leverage the hardware implementation of a neural network into the development of new machine learning optimization techniques, including the optimization of the nonlinear activation function to different tasks.

To make this possible, the operating frequency of communication hardware gets pushed towards ever higher frequencies. The exponentially increasing data consumption from e.g., social media and video streaming, is driving a similar evolution towards higher speed on the optical fiber infrastructure. The ongoing R&D in the wireless and optical fields triggers a strong demand for measurement equipment to cope with the higher frequency range and bandwidth. In particular, there is strong interest by Flemish research groups in a four-channel 110 GHz real-time oscilloscope. This instrument will support research along the complete research value chain from engineering physics, device modeling, integrated circuit design, to characterizing antennas, wireless and optical channels. The consortium groups researchers from all engineering faculties in Flanders (KU Leuven, UGent, and VUB) and IMEC.",

Electronic chips are everywhere: they are the heart of our laptops and smartphones and are largely based on monolithic silicon-based technologies. Photonics is the science and technology that uses light and offers solutions where today's conventional technologies are approaching their limits in terms of speed, capacity and accuracy. Enriching the digital electronics world with photonic chips and materials is the foundation to the next wave of disruptive innovations. The key challenge is to develop a scalable technology that allows for the integration of a heterogeneous variety of photonic chips and materials with electronics, with a cost akin to that of a monolithic silicon chip. This technology is micro-transfer printing. TOPTRANS aims at installing a state-of-the-art wafer-scale microtransfer printing tool. This facility will be unique globally in an academic setting and makes Ghent University a reference center for heterogeneous integration for the coming decade. The tool will contribute significantly to the research of a multidisciplinary consortium of 17 promotors from 6 research groups with a focus on the photonic/electronic systems of the future, such as sensors for autonomous vehicles, AR/VR displays, brain/computer interfaces, quantum computers and wearables for digital health.",

                "project_Description": "The aim of this research project is to provide a decision support system to public health organizations that enables them to respond to several issues that arise during crisis situations, such as the one caused by COVID19. The current COVID19 crisis is a pandemic that has led most countries around the world to be in lock down. Such circumstances can lead to public unrest and it is therefore crucial that governments and health authorities respond appropriately. Two aspects seem to be especially relevant. First, governments should monitor the population\u2019s wellbeing as crisis situations can have a significant impact on mental health. Second, authorities should ensure that citizens get correct information by identifying and rectifying rumours. With this research project we want to show how these two aspects can be fulfilled by analysing public tweets regarding COVID19. During previous pandemics, To do so, we have been collecting public Twitter data regarding COVID19 since January 2020. Since we are mainly interested in the content of the tweet, we only collected information related to the tweet itself. Regarding the user, we only gathered an anonymized user ID. Twitter was used to spread information as well as opinions and experiences. Therefore, tweets can be used for real-time analysis, allowing governments to gain insights on on-going issues and respond accurately. A first objective of this project is to investigate the impact of different events (e.g., lockdown) for different industries (e.g., supermarkets, hair dressers, among others) on wellbeing. To do so, we will identify the relevant events and industries from the text of tweet. We will use the content of the tweet to explain the impact of several events on wellbeing in different industries. We would like to emphasize that wellbeing will be analysed on industry-level and no individual user-level analyses will be conducted. A second objective is to focus on the detection of\u00a0 the rumours about COVID19. A rumour in this case is defined as a piece of information that has not yet been confirmed by government officials, but is already spread on social media. For example, in the beginning of the pandemic several false rumours were spread about the symptoms of the corona virus. In our project, we will focus on detecting tweets that are identified as rumours. To do so, we will build a classification model that will predict whether or not a tweet is a rumour based on several linguistic, content-based, and network features. We will use state-of-the-art deep learning methods to successfully classify tweets as rumours. We would like to stress that no individual identifiable user-level data will be used to classify a tweet as a rumour.",

Using this unified framework, future developments are suggested compromising the three main pilars of talent management: talent identification, talent development, and talent selection.",

A combination of birth-cohort data with new sources of data, will provide insight into aspects of physical and social exposures hitherto untapped. It will do this at different scale levels and timeframes, while accounting for the distribution of exposures in social groups based on gender, ethnicity, social vulnerability. Beginning with child development and mental health, a set of theory-based questions is formulated, a wide range of relevant environmental and social hazards is defined and validated at the stakeholders end. Exposure assessment combines traditional GIS-based approaches with omics approaches and new sources of data that could explain aspects of the urban environment at a higher spatial and temporal granularity, and provide insight into untapped parameters relating to exposure (spatial quality of neighborhoods). These together form the early-life exposome. Statistical tools integrate data at different scale levels and times and combine e.g. machine learning, causal models with subgroups measures. EQUAL-LIFE uses data from birth-cohorts, longitudinal school data sets and cross-sectional studies (N=>250.000) , including data on exposures, biomarkers, mental health and developmental outcomes, in their social context. EQUAL-LIFE contributes to the development/utilization of the exposome concept by 1) integrating the internal, external and social exposome 2) by studying a distinct set of effects on a child\u2019 development and mental health 3) by characterizing/measuring/modelling the child\u2019 environment at different stages and activity spaces 4) by looking at supportive environments for child development, rather than merely pollutants 5) by combining physical, social indicators with novel biomarkers and using new data sources describing child activity patterns and environments.

Compared to popular deep artificial neural network architectures the model is expected to be more robust against catastrophic forgetting, show higher ability to transfer between context and tasks, and is largely explainable. The project foresees validation on extensive datasets showing the performance of the model on classical metrics, but it will also assess the model's biological plausibility by comparing its behavior to human experimental data available at the research group. The project outcome will find applications in smart city sensor networks, context awareness in robots, and human-machine interactions.",

However, current projections suggest that the EU\u2019s 2030 biodiversity target will not be met; an alternative plan is required. PLAN-B takes an integrated, multidisciplinary and multi-actor approach to deliver better understanding and support reduction of light and noise pollution impacts on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services. Key outputs of PLAN-B include: a framework and supporting handbook for assessing light and noise pollution impacts to inform environmental decision-making; an open access database on light and noise impacts on terrestrial biodiversity; spatiotemporal models for evaluating noise and light impacts on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services, including at the European scale; innovative solutions to prevent and mitigate light and noise pollution impacts; recommendations for enhancing legal and policy frameworks to reduce light and noise pollution impacts on terrestrial biodiversity; and sustainable Communities of Practice (CoPs), centred around key stakeholder groups, on the impacts of light and noise on terrestrial biodiversity. Working with European and international partners, including from Brazil, CoPs, key networks (e.g. Biodiversa+) and the Horizon Europe sister project on aquatic biodiversity and ecosystems, PLAN-B will maximise its global reach and research impact. Through its work programme, PLAN-B will create the enabling conditions to support and enhance activities planned in the EU biodiversity strategy and provide a new path towards meeting the EU and international biodiversity targets.",

For example, a quiet fa\u00e7ade offers the possibility to choose a bedroom on the quiet side of a house, thereby reducing the chances on sleep dusturbance by traffic noise. The refuges can be created in new urban areas, but they can also be created by modifying exisitng urban areas, for example by modifying traffic flows or by choosing specific orientations of houses with respect to roads. The benefits of quiet facades and areas will be demonstrated by performing detailed traffic noise mapping calculations for ciets, employing a new noise assessment methodology including the benefits from quiet facades and areas",

In order to succeed, specialists are required with a broad research competence covering areas such as acoustic prediction methods, noise control and soundscaping, but also aspects of city and traffic planning. However, specialists equipped with such a competence spectrum are hardly found. Therefore, the goal of SONORUS is to close this gap and bring together universities, enterprises and public organizations that aim to offer training to ESRs in an arena of trans- disciplinary research. The training is designed around real-life urban test sites that are characterized by a poor acoustic environment due to noise from road, rail or air traffic.",

Yet, current technology burdens neurostimulation tools with bulky, non-biocompatible electrical components that require rigid encapsulation for long-term implantation in body. Recently, we created a novel transistor architecture (internal ion-gated organic electrochemical transistors; IGT) that can be an efficient building block for integrated bioelectronics. These transistors include all the key features required for safe, efficient, and prolonged use of transistors in biological environments: i) they are made out of biocompatible and stable materials; ii) they are soft and conformable; iii) they show high speed and amplification to detect potentially low-amplitude ionic signals of the body; iv) they can perform certain computations. Based on this emerging technology, I propose to design, develop and test novel fully implantable, contained and responsive neural interface devices that will allow long-term acquisition and closed-loop manipulation of neural circuits with high spatiotemporal resolution over extended period of time.",

Embedding a continuous improvement culture throughout the entire organization is paramount in this regard. However, on the contrary, backsliding and loss of momentum are often observed in companies from Western countries and are considered as the main reasons why various approaches to reach operational excellence, such as Lean, frequently do not reach their envisaged effect. Although some companies have succeeded \u2013 but definitely not enough companies to safeguard Flanders\u2019 competitive position \u2013 the majority is looking for a structural approach to enhance and sustain their journey towards operational excellence. This project aims at field testing and validating such a structured approach.\n\u00a0The envisaged structural approach encompasses organizational constructs and management information systems and thus combines research results from the two leading project partners.\n1) (Re)design the Organizational Structure, removing obstacles and thus creating a biotope for effective teamwork, fast problem-solving and continuous improvement. Although the importance of organizational structure has been acknowledged and the tenets of redesign theory are well validated, current theory on the (re)design of the organization is unable to provide accurate advice on how specific tasks and responsibilities should be allocated in a concrete organizational structure. We will fill this gap by complementing the current knowledge with transaction costs theory.\n2) Introduce a LEan MAnagement System (LEMAS). This management information system was recently designed to serve as backbone for the interlocking management loops that typify a Lean organization. LEMAS will regularly provide customized feedback to each involved person at each management level. Shortening the feedback loop allows faster visualization of the effects of improvements, motivating the involved persons. The aim is to validate LEMAS and improve it through user (employees and managers) involvement.",

Their counterpart, collaborative robots (cobots), do allow safe interactions but lack the high performance. This project wants to bridge the gap between high-speed motion and collaboration with humans to address the ever-increasing demand for flexibility in production. To that end we want to design safe and collision-tolerant high-speed cobots. We will first push the working speed of cobots in collaborative mode with flexible links. Instead of considering classical rectangular shaped link designs, axisymmetric links will be studied, as they offer a far more interesting perspective on safety. To contain the undesired side-effects of the link flexibility we will investigate a strain-based control strategy. Secondly, we will push the collision tolerance of today\u2019s high-speed caged robots. We want to protect multi-DOF articulated robot arms by designing overload clutches that allow to rapidly reduce the inertia of the moving robot. This, together with collision detection algorithms. Finally, we will integrate the flexible links and overload clutches to build hybrid high-speed collaborative robots. The new robots will be benchmarked against existing state-of-the-art robots/cobots in terms of speed, collision tolerance and safety, both numerically and experimentally.",

As the nature of tribological interactions is very complex, conventional theoretical and computational approaches are far from being holistic and central in tribology science. This project, therefore, aims at establishing the foundations for a new paradigm in modeling and computation of complex tribological problems. Sparse regression methods are employed to derive governing equations that accurately represent the time evolution of tribological phenomena from given spatiotemporal datasets. Several tribology problems, e.g. dry contact, hydrodynamic lubrication, and elastohydrodynamic lubrication are numerically solved using conventional methods. Thereafter, the acquired time-series datasets will be used to test the correctness of the methodologies developed in this study. Optical fiber sensors are embedded into the metallic and polymeric articulating bodies to be tested by means of a tribological test-rig to measure and collect the internal states of the dynamic system in both space and time. Using the proposed model-discovery techniques, parsimonious models governing the tribological phenomena will be discovered from measurement data. As the resulting models have the capability of interpretability and generalizability, the specific objective of the present study is to infer the Multiphysics of tribology phenomena, i.e. coupled mechanical, metallurgical, thermal and others. Several sizes of bearing components, surface roughness, lubricants, loadings and motion, and material properties will be considered to better understand their contribution to the obtained coefficients appearing in discovered equations. The discovered tribology models are also validated based on not only classical tribology problems but also conservation laws and thermodynamic energy principles.",

A starting point for such theory is the fundamental aspect of what control is, namely the child of two parents: algorithmics and physics. There is no other discipline where both come so close together. Using physics-based and data-driven models we can understand how to interact with the actual physics, using algorithmics we can drive the physics to perform tasks. In this project we aim to develop methodologies that can design control architectures to accommodate for multi-rate dynamics. The coupling between feedback control and feedforward control is studied and how their coupling can be mathematically derived, inversely, starting from known models and control algorithms. We will apply and validate these concepts on robot quadruped tasks and robotic manipulation tasks.",

In an industry 4.0 setting, a higher level of adaptivity and automation is required. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) is a promising enabling technology. However, examples wherein AI techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) are directly in control of (high) power (up to kW) and (highly) dynamic (down to (m)s)) physical systems to improve energy efficiency and performance remain very limited. Going beyond the fixed but safe structure of classical controllers and embracing the RL framework provides the ability to learn and adapt. While doing so, expensive trials and unsafe experimentation on real\nsystems as is common in RL need to be avoided. We therefore propose a fundamentally new approach residing at the intersection of classical control and RL (CTRLxAI). Besides offering increased efficiency and performance (thrust) of the adaptive and autonomous controllers; we will strengthen the trustworthiness (trust) in terms of sample-efficiency, robustness, safety and explainability; critical capabilities for industrial widespread adoption. As such, we will realise our vision CTRLxAI=T (H)RUST. CTRLxAI will focus profoundly on pioneering concepts going beyond the scientific state of the art tackling relevant challenges inspired by the companies in the industrial advisory board. To enable this future utilisation the pioneering CTRLxAI results will be validated up to TRL4-5.

This evolution might entail several unwanted consequences such as production loss, unexpected outages,  etc. Actuators constitute the driving force of every machine. They convert energy into a form that is required by the application. Electromechanical actuators, that convert electrical energy into motion, take up the lion\u2019s share of all actuators (>30%), and like other machine components, they are subject to changes over time.  \nThe State-of-Health (SoH) parameters that characterize this evolution can often not be directly measured such as the  quality of the conductor insulation in electromechanical actuators. In case the evolution exhibits a low probability, in the sense that from all possible changes only a few will occur once over the entire lifetime of a specific actuator (e.g. short-circuit due to failed insulation), no methods exist that are able to estimate various SoH parameters from measurable quantities in order to detect changes.\nTo fill this gap, this PhD project proposes to augment existing models, that use operational data to estimate SoH parameters, with a probabilistic model. This allows exploit historical and recent operational data to estimate various SoH parameters and extend the estimation capabilities by exploring unseen data. Additionally, the registered evolution of SoH parameters will be used to learn to avoid these changes.",

However, this impedes finding systems with concurrent optimal design and trajectory. To address this, multi-disciplinary integrated design methods \u2013 co-design \u2013 have appeared that treat design and trajectory optimization simultaneously. However, as yet, co-design has only been applied to low-fidelity models, that are cheap to evaluate but typically lack the ability to correctly represent reality. In this proposal I wish to push model-based system design further by including high-fidelity models, that more accurately capture the system\u2019s actual behavior but come at an increased computational cost. To do this, I introduce surrogate-assisted methodologies that possess the ability to include high-fidelity models in co-design. I intend to validate the new methodology by performing a model-based design of an unmanned aerial vehicle with the objective of enabling medical transportation beyond its current capabilities, that are presently limited by range. Furthermore, the methodological development will also enable the innovative design of e.g. airborne wind energy and break through the current barrier of several fields to accelerate the transition towards renewable energy.",

Drivetrains are key in various industrial applications and need to be reliable and have to assure proper operational performances. Nowadays increasing computational resources allow model-based scenario testing and design techniques. However, intricate drivetrains are plagued by nonlinearities and uncertainties that are hard to capture with solely physical laws. Traditional data-driven techniques on the other hand can have poor extrapolation capabilities, i.e. predictions outside their training region can become progressively worse. This project proposes a dynamic hybrid modeling formalism, by intimately merging physics-based with data-driven models that aims at improved accuracy, robustness and extrapolation capabilities. Research will be devoted to inserting these formalisms into virtual scenario testing for the detection of unwanted phenomena, as well as for optimal control strategy and design of drivetrains. Finally, this project delivers a generic toolbox that allows proper interfacing with the drivetrain experts and drivetrain systems to have optimal interplay with the developed algorithms.",

This applies for example to the thermal evaluation of electric motors where operating at high-power density may lead to excessive temperatures, or to the verification of high strain levels in extensive load cycles within mechanical structures (system housing & rotating components) that may lead to fatigue issues. An inaccurate knowledge of both quantities (strain and temperature) may thus lead to excessive safety factors, over-dimensioned systems or in case of under-dimensioning; failing prototypes. The SBO project FiberMech aims at unlocking the potential of distributed strain and temperature estimation in mechatronic systems at lower cost/time and improved accuracy with respect to conventional strain gauges and thermal sensors. A more time/cost-efficient, but elaborate measurement campaign will decrease the number of design iterations and save expensive physical prototyping. To reach this objective, we aim to take advantage of a new technological opportunity, optical fiber sensors for dynamic mechatronic systems, and combine it with virtual sensing principles. High-fidelity numerical models will be created for both independent strain and temperature estimation with improved accuracy for the assessment of prototypes. In particular FiberMech will deliver tools and methods for (1) multi-physical model reduction with corresponding co-simulation scheme to yield a gain in computation time and (2) reduction of optic sensor measurement uncertainty to accurately identify strain/temperature.\nThe tools and methods will be developed for mechatronic products covering a broad application field: (1) estimation of mechanical inputs for multiple force components; (2) improved temperature estimation in electric motors; (3) estimation of torsional loads and bending moments for electro-mechanical rotary drivetrains. Small validation cases will also be defined with the User Group members to evaluate the feasibility of the reusable results in an industrial environment.",

Still, the optimization-based nature of MPC currently hampers widespread adoption in industrial mechatronic systems: current MPC implementations are expensive in terms of compute and memory resources, computation time is non-deterministic, and therefore MPC algorithms cannot be certified to working with a certain sampling rate, MPC development and implementation is not easy and involves high engineering costs because the right tools are lacking.\nThe project \"Deterministic and Inexpensive Realizations of Advanced Control\" (DIRAC) aims at a breakthrough of MPC in the mechatronic / mechanical engineering / manufacturing industry by solving all obstacles through performance that revolves around the three keywords in the title:\n\nDeterministically: New MPC algorithms and approaches will be developed that can operate reliably at a given sample rate, as well as methods to verify their worst computation times and control performance.\nCheap:\r\n\nImplementations will be made that approach \"full\" (= online non-linear optimization with high-fidelity models) MPC and can thus run on low-cost computer hardware with a quantifiable impact on the control performance that is calculated in advance.\nA modular MPC toolbox will be developed that will allow the development, tuning and validation of advanced control at manageable engineering costs.\n\n\nAchievements: We will demonstrate the MPC toolbox and the potential of MPC on industrially relevant demonstrators and validation cases to break the status quo in control practices, stimulate acceptance and inspire Flemish industry.\n\nThe overarching, tangible, reusable overall result of this project is a toolbox that simplifies the design of non-linear MPC controllers and brings methodological advancements in solvers, approximations and validation techniques within the reach of control practitioners.",

Flanders Make DecisionS, FlandersMake@UGent-EEDT-DC, Bekaert and Atlas Copco were partners in MODA.\u00a0 These interactions as well as those with many other companies confirmed that Flemish industry heavily relies on\u00a0models of physical dynamic systems\u00a0(e.g., drivetrain models, thermal models, actuator models) to realize applications such as\u00a0monitoring\u00a0(e.g., anomaly detectors, condition estimators, lifetime predictors), selection of\u00a0(control) settings\u00a0(e.g., model-based controllers) and\u00a0controller designs\u00a0(e.g., data driven controllers). However, physical modelling of certain quantities like friction, flexibilities, wear out to the desired level of accuracy is very time consuming. The growing availability of industrial data is an opportunity that can be exploited to overcome these shortcomings by combining physical models with\u00a0AI technology.\u00a0Hybrid models\u00a0(HMs),\u00a0for which a basic framework has been developed within the MODA project, allow\u00a0physical models and AI driven models working in tandem. The key innovation is that instead of merely matching unknown parameters in a physical model with data, unknown dynamic behavior is modelled in a data driven manner.\u00a0 Hybrid models have increased\u00a0extrapolatability and/or transferability\u00a0(hereafter referred to\u00a0\u201ctranspolatability\u201d) compared to pure AI models.

The limited number of degrees of freedom in the hybrid models \u2013\u00a0\u00a0compared to pure AI models \u2013 naturally leads to higher robustness, which combined with interpretability significantly increases their trustworthiness. HAIEM will further develop the MODA framework towards\u00a0transpolatability.

The latter will be achieved by investigating how\u00a0transfer learning\u00a0methods for pure AI models can be tailored to apply on hybrid models without the strong need for rich datasets.

In addition to the traditional functions (eg process and performance monitoring), new ones are constantly being added (eg in-line quality control, online status monitoring, comfort estimation).\nTraditionally, each monitoring functionality is developed depending on the others and the sensors are not divided among the different functionalities. This approach simplifies the design process, but the result is not optimal. It leads to mechatronic systems with too many sensors, spread over too many locations. Until now, with relatively few monitoring functionalities, this non-optimality was often still acceptable. But with the increasing number of monitoring functionality, this non-optimality becomes too great.\nTraditionally, each monitoring functionality is also tested separately and through real-life experiments. However, the increasing number of functionalities now multiplies the test costs and so a new approach is required.\nIn short, companies need to optimize the way they design and test multifunctional multi-sensor monitoring systems. With this project, we aim to develop a structured software tool-supported methodology for designing and virtual testing of multifunctional multi-sensor monitoring systems.",

                "project_Description": "Machine controllers have to evolve to keep up with current mechatronic trends. First, machines are getting more complex, involving more complex or simply more subsystems, requiring their controllers to evolve accordingly. Second, the number of tasks and conditions under which machines operate is increasing, for example due to mass adjustment, making it more difficult for a single controller to deal with this variation, as well as making tuning this controller more difficult. Finally, more and more additional requirements need to be considered, such as energy-optimized controllers instead of satisfactory lightweight structures, ease of maintenance and tuning, ... all of which require a more complex controller and more difficult control design. With classic control, these challenges are tackled by experienced control technicians. However, this is a difficult job and can result in sub-optimal solutions with poor performance or in very long and costly tuning procedures. Learning control can be used as a more systematic approach to meeting these needs. This learning is currently done on a system-by-system basis, so it is repeated independently for each system, with each controller attempting to independently cope with changes in conditions, without taking advantage of the similarity between the systems to speed up this process.\nThe new trend to interconnect mechatronic systems (directly or via the cloud) offers new ways to improve these learning algorithms: instead of learning by machine, we propose to learn for multiple systems in parallel by sharing information and research load, resulting in an overall learning algorithm that is more efficient (shorter convergence periods) and more effective (better performance across all systems, which is achieved through a monotonically improving learning process). Since there are no learning control techniques for multiple systems to date, we will start from the existing learning control with one system and expand it.\nThe development of multi-system learning controls will lead to improvements for a wide range of companies, such as faster commissioning of a new fleet of systems, faster commissioning of a single system when added to an existing fleet, an adaptation of a fleet after a software update ... There will also be improvements for systems operating in variable but similar conditions and for systems operating in the same environment, allowing them to adapt faster by sharing information. Furthermore, there will also be an advantage for facilitating technology providers and technical service providers who can make use of these techniques.\nIn addition to the direct impact for a wide range of companies, the proposed research is a first innovative step in a new field, as there is currently very little activity in this field, even at a global level, but one that we believe is an important research topic will be in the years to come.",

The project aims to bridge the gap between product design and assembly system design by incorporating assembly knowledge into the early stages of product development. Today, most companies look at assembly aspects later in the design process, often manually, relying solely on the experience of assembly engineers. This later leads to numerous design changes, resulting in significant additional costs. Today's industry context requires companies to strive for a first-time-right, \"down to lot size 1 at the expense of volume production\" strategy. Thinking about installation aspects too late or experimentally is therefore no longer an option.\n\u00a0\nAs these software tools go beyond the state-of-the-art, the research partners (FM-CodesignS, FMProductionS, AnSyMo / CoSys lab, DMMS and EEDT) will join forces to develop the state-of-the-art in product assembly co design, aimed at the following innovation goals:\n\na software environment for formalizing assembly knowledge (e.g. Design-for-Assembly rules, assembly complexity metrics),\ntools and algorithms for automated multi-objective optimization of the early design of a product, considering product performance and assembly complexity,\ntools and algorithms to automatically find the optimal assembly process (sequence of steps) and assembly system (resource allocation), for a given product design and\na framework for the co-design of both the product and the assembly system by combining both 2) and 3) in a semi-automatic workflow.\n\n\u00a0\nTo achieve this framework, the research partners propose 4 core research work packages, following a step-by-step approach: (i) quantification of DFA rules and measurement data of assembly complexity, (ii) integration of these into product optimization, (iii) automatic derivation and optimization of assembly process and system from a product design and (iv) semi-automatic product assembly co-design. The main tangible results consist of a meta model to describe a product, the assembly process and the assembly system, a graphical user interface for the transformation from qualitative DFA rules to quantitative assembly complexity statistics, optimization algorithms for an optimal product, assembly process and assembly system design and a workflow to perform product assembly co-design by combining these optimization algorithms.\n\u00a0\nThe project will use at least 3 generic use cases (related to the co-design challenges), defined in close collaboration with the companies of the user group, and the results will be validated on small validation cases (defined by the companies). The project will result in a methodology, supported by software tools, for product assembly co-design.

Horses are known to show benign arrhythmias, but the differentiation between benign and dangerous arrhythmias is often difficult, though very important. Current equipment for arrhythmia detection is expensive and can only be used by trained veterinarians (cardiac specialists) and even then, techniques are not adapted to horses. The first purpose of this study is to develop a new device that facilitate and improve the diagnosis of equine arrhythmias in the field. Hardware and software will be developed that is affordable, easy to use and automatic so that it can be used by every veterinarian but also by the horse owners themselves. These tools will allow daily monitoring and thus help to prevent sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, the second purpose is to develop advanced techniques for more accurately determining the type of arrhythmia and to get insight into normal and abnormal ventricular activation patterns and electro-anatomy. Better detection of arrhythmias in the field and improved knowledge of the underlying mechanisms are mandatory for risk reduction of sudden death and for further development of targeted therapies.",

Recent research advancements apply machine learning to predict the occurrence of these breakdowns. Based on the collection of historical data describing the circumstances before these malfunctions appear, models are trained to find patterns in the data that predict the remaining life time of a machine. The main drawback of these approaches is however their reliance on (lots of) data to be able to function well for many types of failures and operating conditions. Therefore, in this research proposal, I aim to guide these models to the right solution by also providing them with physical knowledge available about the machine. Engineers often have detailed knowledge about the physical behavior of the machines they design. For example, when a car engine is running, it should not exceed certain temperatures or noise levels. When it does, something is wrong with the engine, meaning that it will fail soon. Instead of having the models to learn these known patterns from historical data, we will provide them with this expert knowledge from the beginning. This enables them to learn much faster and with less data. In addition, we don't want to retrain these programs for every new environment a machine is deployed in (e.g., different weather conditions). The models should be smart enough to extrapolate important warning signs they have learned from other environments.",

These sensors also require modern deep learning algorithms to perform detection, tracking, etc.\nThe goal of my proposal is to develop new neural network design methodologies for deep learning that are optimized for embedded devices. As there is a wide range of use-cases for small devices with onboard AI capabilities, deep learning algorithms need to be able to scale to the available computing resources. I will therefore design algorithms that adapt to the available power budget, latency, etc.\n\nThe main novelty of my work is to focus on scaling the computational complexity of the algorithm by adapting the neural network execution to the input. Some inputs are easier to process than others, as humans we also perceive this, sometimes we recognize things immediately and other times we need to focus longer. In deep learning the trend of the recent years has been that bigger networks achieve better accuracy. However for many inputs, a smaller and faster network is sufficient. By making neural networks scalable on a per-input basis, the required computations to analyse an input sample can scale with the perceived difficulty of that sample. This will allow faster execution for easy to analyse inputs while maintaining the full power of a slower but more accurate network for inputs that are harder to interpret.",

Yet, crucial to our ability to process this hyperdimensional stream of sensory information, is that we do not always devote the same level of mental effort to all sensory inputs. This dynamic scalability allows us to extract the relevant information from the sensory data with our limited human computational bandwidth. Wouldn\u2019 it be great if electronics could also benefit from such scalable processing of a hyperdimensional stream of sensory data? This would enable robots, drones, cars, or buildings to constantly be aware of their complete surroundings. Currently, such devices struggle to process hyperdimensional visual data under the energy and processing constraints of embedded devices. This can be overcome by bringing in similar dynamic scalability when processing the hyperdimensional data. HYPERSCALES will enable such always-on hyper-dimensional, scalable sensing, focusing on visual sensors. The goal is to demonstrate a ring of many low-cost visual sensors, capturing a rich datastream of omnidirectional information. Using a new paradigm of online scalable neural networks, and aligned dynamic scaling of customly designed hardware, always-on visual awareness will become feasible with an order or magnitude lower energy consumption than the state-of-theart.

The main idea is that these algorithms allow computer systems to \u201clearn from experience\u201d. By giving examples of e.g. handwritten digits, the computer can learn to recognize digits it has never seen before and classify them as 1, 2 et cetera. This shows that ML is inspired by the functioning of the human brain. From the moment we are born, our senses are influenced by the environment: we hear things and learn a language, we see objects and learn their properties, we see how other people move and learn to walk ourselves.A lot of techniques have been developed that can learn certain relations and distinguishdifferent patterns. Few techniques however exist that have all the properties of the humanbrain. Our brain is robust: if we see a breed of dog that we never saw before, we know it\u2019s adog. Our brain can infer things and generalize observations: we don\u2019t have to taste everystrawberry to know that it\u2019s sweet. Our brain recognizes changes very fast: if a person starts running we don\u2019t need to observe him for a few seconds to realize that he is moving faster.My research proposes the combination of two techniques, namely Recurrent Neural Networks(based on early ideas about the functioning of neurons) and Bayesian Inference (a method that calculates probabilities based on observations). By combining these techniques, the aim is to produce systems that are robust, fast and can generalize when used in highly dynamic environments. The main idea is to learn a model for this environment and then try to invert the model to make predictions on the basis of real observations. When this is successful, these models can be used to control complex processes. This is a novel approach that could outperform state of the art applications. Moreover it has a promise to provide an insight in the exact functioning of the brain.",

Similarly to our brain, which faces an equivalent computational challenge every day, it will do this in an energy-efficient way. By processing optical signals instead of electrical ones, it will also be faster than electronic solutions. Indeed, as illustrated by the recent development of optical interconnections to increase the information transfer in future generation digital chips, the transfer of large amounts of information can happen at higher speeds and using less power. Additionally, optical phenomena have much richer intrinsic dynamics, making it easier to mimic neural behaviour.During my PhD research, I have studied a class of tiny optical components that indeed behave phenomenologically identical to biological neurons. I will now integrate them into a larger network, and incorporate an electronic layer on top of the optical layer that will allow the system to learn from examples.",

This is due to the high amount of deformations that occur on soft objects. In order to reach new productivity gains in these industries, we need robotic manipulators that can handle this large configuration space. An answer can be found in the domain of machine learning where a solution is learned instead of programmed. In particular, the use of deep reinforcement learning has recently solved very complex problems such as winning Atari games and controlling a robotic arm without prior knowledge and using visual feedback only. Therefore, we will in this project investigate the use of deep reinforcement learning to train a robot controller to fold clothing based on visual human task demonstrations. This solution can relieve employees from repetitious tasks and let them focus on value-added activities requiring a human operator.",

They will be integrated in chips in the same way as for example the processor of your phone or computer. Integrated systems are compact, fast, cost-efficient and have a wide variety of possible functions. Using light instead of electrical signals is more power efficient and faster among other advantages. Others have already been looking at such systems but most of them in a non integrated way using bulky components such as optical fibers. There also has not been sufficient research on using multiple wavelengths and the little research that was done focused on using the different wavelengths to perform different tasks at the same time. In my work, apart from integrating the systems on chips, I will take a step further by also looking into using different wavelengths to better perform a single task. The systems will be useful particularly for processing optical data such as in telecom or medical imaging. Examples are processing an internet signal coming from an optical fiber or determining if a passing blood cell is a cancer cell or not.",

These analyses are done with specialised software tools such as Unipept.

Unipept is widely used in the field because of its performance, user-friendliness and interactive data visualisations. \n\nRecently, the field of metaproteomics has been moving towards bigger, high-throughput experiments. Unipept, as a web-based tool, is not an ideal fit to handle this data deluge. Its set of command line tools, on the other hand, are specifically created for high-throughput experiments, but they lack the user-friendliness and interactive visualisations of the web application. This research proposal aims to solve these shortcomings by creating a Unipept desktop application.

These proteins are the \u2018worker\u2019 molecules in cells, carrying out the chemical reactions that sustain life, and that ensure communication with other cells in the community and with the host organism. Metaproteomics is frequently applied to gain insight into human gut microbiota, the microbial communities that live on and around plant roots, and the fermenting microbes in biogas reactors. Yet, despite its popularity, the ability of metaproteomics to provide detailed insight in the actual workings of the investigated communities is held back by a lack of computational tools to analyse and interpret the acquired data. This project therefore directly addresses this issue, by developing two crucial computational components. The first is a performant identification algorithm that translates the acquired data into protein identifications, and the second is a dedicated quantification algorithm that will provide the relative amounts of proteins present across different samples (for instance, healthy compared to ill people, growing compared to dying crops, and performant compared to stalled biogas reactors). I will also implement these new algorithms in easy-to-use, free and open source software so that as many people as possible will be able to make use of our tools to analyse their own as well as other people\u2019s data (which are available online).",

This way, we can gain insight into the processes that take place in ecosystems, find out about disruptions and discover potential solutions to resolve imbalances.\n\nUnfortunately, the available software to analyse this wealth of data is clearly lagging behind the technical advances in the field. To remedy this, we developed Unipept, a user-friendly web application that enables researchers to easily explore their data using interactive data visualisations. Originally, we were primarily interested in sample biodiversity, but recently we have shifted our focus to the functional composition and the link between organisms and functions.\n\nThe analyses in Unipept are done on a per-sample basis, but to get the most out of the data, it is necessary to be able to compare multiple samples and detect shifts in composition. This research proposal aims to add such comparative analysis to Unipept in an easy to use, but statistically-correct way.

The mechanisms of biochar and chitin underlying these beneficial effects on plant growth and health and the relation with the microbiome is so far poorly understood. A time series experiment will be conducted in which strawberry plants grown in potting soil, biochar- or chitin-amended potting soil are sampled weekly. Several high-throughput sequencing techniques (metabarcoding, -genomics, -transcriptomics) will be used to characterize the rhizosphere microbiome, while potting soil physicochemical variables, plant gene expression and plant growth data will be collected in parallel on each time point. By studying each component of microbiome-plant-substrate system and correlating their temporal changes, we will be able to link the effect of biochar and chitin on the rhizosphere microbiome to plant growth and disease resistance, and to unravel the underlying mode of action.

However, it is still unknown who is \u201ckey\u201d and how they induce the chitin-related plant growth promotion, which is probably linked to at least one of the following mechanisms: (1) the release of plant available N by chitin degradation; (2) the deacetylation of chitin to chitosan, a recognized plant growth promoter; (3) the activation of other microbial mechanisms related to growth promotion. In this project, I aim to clarify the mode of action of chitin on plant growth promotion. Chitin degraders will be identified by combining stable isotope probing and metagenomics analyses. Next, chitin degradation will be quantified through a targeted metabolomics approach and metatranscriptomics. The data will finally be combined to select strains for which we will validate growth promotion and chitin-degrading capacities using various bioassays including a fast-screening tool I will develop to identify key microbial species/microbial enzymes in growing media which will help to predict the efficacy of chitin as a plant beneficial.",

The relevance of the formalization of this simple notion of aggregation can be\n\n\n\nquantified by countless papers, special issues, edited volumes, monographs, conferences, summer\n\n\n\nschools, etc. Indeed, there exists a whole community centred on the study of aggregation\n\n\n\nprocesses. However, although it constitutes an impressive body of mathematical knowledge, most\n\n\n\ntheoretically-oriented studies are confined to the aggregation of real numbers or, in more exotic\n\n\n\ncases, to other ordered structures, such as intervals or ordinal linguistic scales. Shamefully, the\n\n\n\naggregation of non-ordered structures, such as graphs, strings and ranking data, is mostly\n\n\n\naddressed by practitioners. One could say that, while the practical framework is full of \"ad hoc\"\n\n\n\nmethods, the theoretical framework is embarrassingly narrow. Both theory and practice do not\n\n\n\nhitherto converge. This divergence is mainly motivated by two factors: 1) the difficulty of fully\n\n\n\nunderstanding some black-box-esque practical aggregation techniques 2) the computational\n\n\n\nchallenge that applying some complex theoretical aggregation techniques implies.

Computers have demonstrated a recognition rate better than or comparable to human performance in several tasks, such as visual recognition and recommendation systems. Despite these success stories, an important gap continues to exist for a long time between the scalability and the complexity of the problems handled by humans and those solved by computers. Most of the problems solved by computers using machine learning techniques involve at most few hundreds of categories (labels) while humans are able to discriminate at least tens of thousands of categories. Statistical and computational challenges posed by the presence of an extremely large number of labels have opened a new line of research, which is referred to as extreme classification. In such a setting, standard methods that have a training and prediction cost linear in the number of labels become intractable. Algorithms for extreme classification often require a sublinear time and space complexity. Another major challenge lies in that fact that getting reliable training information is a difficult task, therefore, one has to deal with the problem of learning from unreliable information. Given these challenges, this project aims to develop new algorithms for efficiently solving extreme classification problems. The proposed algorithms will be supported by empirical as well as theoretical studies.",

In particular, biofilms formed on medical implants often lead to chronic infection and implant replacement, whereas biofilms in food and other industries can lead to product contamination. This project aims at the development of a novel sensor technology, based on impedance measurement by microelectrode arrays, that allows for in vivo and in situ biofilm detection and monitoring. Recent evidence collected at KU Leuven and Imec suggests that this technology has potential not only to detect biofilms and notify in time that antimicrobial treatment is required, but also to measure biofilm structure, inform on the most\neffective type of antimicrobial treatment and monitor the clearance process. Since this technology is based on microelectrodes, costeffective implementation in a broad variety of applications should be feasible. As such, successful development of this technology is anticipated to largely contribute to solving the biofilm problem. The first\nproject pillar focuses on studying mechanisms by which biofilm formation affects impedance and the application of supervised machine learning to predict effective antimicrobial treatment protocols based on impedance data. The second pillar focuses on sensor optimization and implementation in demonstrator devices. The final pillar aims at\ndelivering strong proof-of-concept, by applying the technology to in vivo biofilm monitoring on medical implants (rabbit model) and in situ application in food production installations (pilot-scale installations and industrial validation cases).

This move implies the need for high-quality predictive models for simulation and optimisation problems both for unit operations as well as for plant-wide scenarios. In these continuous production lines, much of the measurement data can be expressed as a distribution, e.g. a particle size distribution. Currently, these measurements are reduced to some characteristic and most of the information content is ignored. As such, a non-linear distribution-agnostic data-driven model framework is proposed to leverage the information content: Kernel Mean Embedding (KME). KME translates a distribution to a point in a high-dimensional feature space while retaining all information of the distribution, and being computationally efficient. These mean embeddings can be used for representation, visualisation, regression and optimisation problems. Extensions to the theory are proposed to create informative monitoring tools, to make prediction models with complex multi-dimensional distributions, to add uncertainty to the model predictions and to add the concept of statistical significance to KME. Finally, these extensions are used to solve optimisation problems: how to optimally select materials to attain certain target quality attributes? How to interpolate between formulations or how to perform experimental design with particular limitations?",

Besides phytopathological damage that causes the disease, there is a risk of contamination of the infected grain with mycotoxins. The concern of the European Union for the presence of Fusarium mycotoxins in cereals was materialized in 2006 by the introduction of a standard for the main mycotoxin viz. Deoxynivalenol (DON). Arfusarium in Flanders is a difficult problem to manage. Due to the large variability in appearance, the prediction of a aarfusariumaantasting is not easy and not be realized with simple weighting based or logistic regression methods. Indeed, the damage is the result of many variables that may be mutually correlated. Yet it is necessary from the viewpoint of the farmer to estimate whether the cultivation of corn increased risk of Fusarium and / or seen DON contaminated corn exists possibly no longer marketable. The main objective of this research proposal is to implement learning algorithms for the prediction of Fusarium and DON in grains in the advisory system EPIPRE. EPIPRE is an advisory system that wheat growers are guided individually in Belgium and France to obtain an optimal financial return. Based on the predicted risk EPIPRE should then be able to make the project results input for preventive management advice both at the start of the cultivation in the course of cultivation. The prediction model must also provide a more adequate and targeted sampling in the detection of mycotoxins, both at the level of the grower and the trade and this in the context of IKKB programa's.",

Belgium has recently approved a new regulatory framework as the first country worldwide, enabling tailor-made phage products to be used in magistral preparations for treatment of individual patients.\n\nToday, the development process of phage-based biologicals remains labor-intensive and costly. In my PhD project, I will focus on developing machine learning tools to predict bacteria-phage interactions at the strain level and creating digital phagograms based on experimental validation (equivalent to an antibiogram for antibiotics). Machine learning algorithms will learn from known interactions between bacteria and phage proteins to predict new interactions. This enables rapid selection and production of appropriate phages, which significantly increases the speed at which phages are characterized. Our research units will work with the Queen Astrid military hospital (see letter of support) to incorporate this framework in their phage therapy approach.

However, wastewater treatment plants are complex systems. The operator simultaneously needs to safeguard the stability of the plant, make sure to meet the effluent standards, and keep the operational costs as low as possible. Unfortunately, often only the first objective (stability) is achieved in practice. There is thus ample room for improvement of the operational control strategy. We identified the following areas of improvement. The plant should be considered as a whole by implementing 1) a plant-wide control strategy that uses 2) all available data. 3) Temporal trends should be taken into account and 4) the control strategy should adapt continuously to changes in the process. By taken these considerations into account, the operational performance of wastewater treatment plants can be improved.\n\nWe propose the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an alternative control strategy. Deep RL is a machine learning technique that automatically learns to take optimal actions through repeated interaction with the wastewater treatment plant. Moreover, Deep RL meets all four of the abovementioned areas of improvement. In this proposed research project, we will investigate the performance of Deep RL as a control strategy in theoretical and real wastewater treatment plants and ultimately perform a full-scale implementation.",

Today, the uptake of data science in practice is hindered mostly by a growing skills gap. Indeed, the application of data science techniques still requires sophisticated and rapidly evolving technical skills, and the demand for such skills grows faster than the suitably trained workforce. This project aims to address this skills gap by developing novel principles for automating data science tasks that today seem too openended, too domain-dependent, or involve data that is too complex, to allow doing so.",

Often, these data are collected for no specific purpose, or they turn out to be useful for unanticipated purposes: Companies constantly look for new ways to monetize their customer databases; Governments mine various databases to detect tax fraud; Security agencies mine and cross-associate numerous heterogeneous information streams from publicly accessible and classified databases to understand and detect security threats. The objective in such Exploratory Data Mining (EDM) tasks is typically ill-defined, i.e. it is unclear how to formalize how interesting a pattern extracted from the data is. As a result, EDM is often a slow process of trial and error. During this fellowship we aim to develop the mathematical principles of what makes a pattern interesting in a very subjective sense. Crucial in this endeavour will be research into automatic mechanisms to model and duly consider the prior beliefs and expectations of the user for whom the EDM patterns are intended, thus relieving the users of the complex task to attempt to formalize themselves what makes a pattern interesting to them. This project will represent a radical change in how EDM research is done. Currently, researchers typically imagine a specific purpose for the patterns, try to formalize interestingness of such patterns given that purpose, and design an algorithm to mine them. However, given the variety of users, this strategy has led to a multitude of algorithms. As a result, users need to be data mining experts to understand which algorithm applies to their situation. To resolve this, we will develop a theoretically solid framework for the design of EDM systems that model the user's beliefs and expectations as much as the data itself, so as to maximize the amount of useful information transmitted to the user. This will ultimately bring the power of EDM within reach of the non-expert.",

A main cause of this evolution is people\u2019s innate dependence on cognitive heuristics to process information, which may lead to biases and poor decision making. These biases risk being amplified in a networked society, where people depend on others to form their opinions and judgments and to determine their actions. Contemporary generative Artificial Intelligence technologies may further exacerbate this risk, given their ability to fabricate and efficiently spread false but highly convincing information at an unprecedented scale. Combined with expected advances in virtual, augmented, mixed, and extended reality technologies, this may create an epistemic crisis with consequences that are hard to fully fathom: a post-truth era on steroids.  In the VIGILIA project, we will investigate a possible mitigation strategy. We propose to develop automated techniques for detecting triggers of cognitive biases and heuristics in humans when facing information, as well as their effect at an interpersonal level (their effect on trust, reputation, and information propagation), and at a societal level (in terms of possible irrational behaviour and polarization). We aim to achieve this by leveraging techniques from AI itself, in particular Large Language Models, as well as by building on advanced user modelling approaches from the past ERC Consolidator Grant FORSIED. Our results will be integrated within tools that we refer to as VIrtual GuardIan AngeLs (VIGILs), aimed at news and social media consumers, journalists, scientific researchers, and political decision makers.

Indeed, standard clinical, microscopic, and medical imaging modalities are currently limited in their potential to quantify PM and evaluate PIPAC responses. The goal of this research project is to tackle both problems by bringing together expertise in cancer oncology and artificial intelligence.

Context-aware embedding models recently revolutionized the field of natural language processing, with long-range dependency modelling as a key feature, and promising results have also been obtained with similar methods applied to protein representation learning. \nWe aim to enrich such self-supervised embedding models by also training them for structural prediction, using publicly available protein structures. We will study how this can improve prediction performance on two structure-dependent downstream tasks. The first is protein secretability by yeast, a feature of high impact in fundamental biology and biotechnology. The second is kinase substrate site prediction, which is important in pharmacology. For both, labeled experimental datasets are available at the host lab, through novel experimental methods and novel data extraction methods. \nFurthermore, for proteins with known 3D structures, we will use attribution methods to map sequence- and structural input features that are learned as decisive factors by the models. In collaboration with the lab\u2019s experimentalists, we will verify the fragments of the human proteome that our model predicts to be secretable, and evaluate predicted secretability-enhancing modifications.",

Likewise, machine learning methods can be exploited to find hidden connections and correlations between the different degrees of freedom in a physical system. Computer resources required to apply standard algorithms to the study of complex physical systems, typically scale with the system size in an exponential way. Overcoming this unfavorable exponential scaling is a challenging issue. We will use neural networks as a model for these physical systems and use the physics of the complex system to learn about the operation of the neural networks. In this process the computer optimizes the different parameters in the neural network such that it models the physical system under study. It is our aim to unravel the various steps that the neural network has taken to model the physics. This will allow us to unravel the underlying principles and to forge connections between machine learning and physics, to the mutual benefit of both branches of sciences.",

However, protein secretion is a complex process of cellular machinery interacting with the nascent protein, and its complexity makes that prediction of (fragment) secretability of a given protein is in general still impossible. In this project, we will use a new technology that was recently developed in our laboratory, which generates experimental secretability data on hundreds of thousands of protein fragments, in yeast. We have already demonstrated that these datasets, in combination with modern machine learning, reveal unexpected protein features that are important for protein secretion, and that predictive models can be built which can predict whether a particular protein fragment is likely to be secretable or not. This methodology allows to tackle longstanding research questions about the secretory system, such as how the nature of the secretory signal influences protein secretion and which protein types require which chaperones for productive folding. We expect that the generated knowledge will be immensely useful for the fundamental understanding of the eukaryotic secretory processes, as well as for overcoming practical issues in heterologous protein secretion.",

As the industry becomes more commercialized the customers become more concerned with the overall welfare of livestock and farmers are looking to further increase the profit margins.

This information can then be used to further optimize the production process and ensure optimal living conditions for the animals. By equipping each goat with a small wirelessly connected accelerometer and UWB tag we can collect both activity and positional information. By applying novel deep learning techniques on this data we can extract useful behavioral statistics as well as detect key events, such as kidding, and health or welfare issues. To ensure a broad applicability of the proposed system we will focus on reducing both the required infrastructure as the power consumption of the sensors. To this end a significant part of this study will be focused on both the reduction of the required wireless and localization infrastructure as well as on the optimization of the power consumption of the wireless link and on-device processing.",

Not only does this revolution imply the need for process monitoring on an unprecedented scale, the processes to be monitored are often already in place and poorly suited for many existing (wired) monitoring technologies due to limitations concerning cost, footprint, scale, etc. To combat these limitations, an increasing number of organizations are looking into wireless solutions. Nonetheless, some environments are so prohibitive that even state of the art wireless technologies can\u2019t achieve ubiquitous connectivity. Isolated industrial sites with large metal constructions such as petrochemical plants, ship compartments, oilrigs and container terminals come to mind. In such challenging environments, it is not uncommon to observe highly localized changes in wireless link quality due to time-varying effects. As such, rather than using fixed radio settings, each individual wireless link could be configured according to its local operating conditions. The main benefits of this approach are twofold: (i) area agnostic network optimization within a single deployment and (ii) ubiquitous connectivity in challenging industrial sites. The goal of this project is to enable such area agnostic / ubiquitous connectivity for industry by harnessing the radio flexibility of future wireless platforms, i.e., Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) for IoT.",

Understanding all aspects of complex wireless systems and providing solutions becomes infeasible, even for domain experts. As a consequence, in wireless systems there is an ongoing trend to apply machine learning, a technique were computers learn from data to avoid the need of knowledge from experts. Machine learning is currently used in wireless networks for tasks such as performance prediction, recognition of technologies such as Wi-Fi, LTE, Bluetooth, etc. and network optimisation (e.g. localization system with heterogeneous settings). However, state of the art approaches require big datasets with annotations regarding performance and technologies of samples. This approach requires companies to spend a huge amount of time on (manual) dataset generation and annotation before any value is created, making big data learning approach too expensive for many problems encountered by Flemish networking companies. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop techniques that enable \"small data\"-based wireless machine learning, either by intelligently collecting less but more relevant information or by reusing insights from past optimisations.

Such applications are expected to require up to several gigabits per second (Gbps) of throughput, as well as millisecond end-to-end latency to enable interactivity. Current wireless local area networking (WLAN) technologies, such as Wi-Fi, cannot attain such high throughputs. However, increasing the radio transmission frequency up to the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band (i.e., 30-300 gigahertz), would support network throughputs up to tens or even hundreds of Gbps. One important hurdle needs to be overcome though: mmWave transmission suffers from high propagation loss and heavy attenuation by obstacles (e.g., walls, people). As such, latency and throughput are highly variable due to user movement and obstacles. In WaveVR we aim to address this issue, and make mmWave technology suitable for future interactive VR/AR applications with mobile devices. We will achieve stable throughput and millisecond latency by introducing the novel concept of context-awareness to mmWave networks. User, network and environmental context (e.g., user location and movement, detected obstacles) will be used to optimize protocols from the data link to the application layer, and enable seamless multi access point transmissions to avoid obstacles. A novel evaluation approach, combining technical metrics with user perception is envisioned.",

                "project_Description": "Over the last decades, the Internet has evolved from a research network connecting a couple of hundred nodes to a system connecting billions of users around the globe. This astonishing evolution has been driven by a continuous innovation, both in terms of technology, service offering and user requirements. While in the early days the Internet was mainly used for static services such as e-mail and web browsing, a wide variety of rich services is offered today, mostly focusing on multimedia delivery. More specifically, video streaming services are dominating the Internet today, representing over 70% of the total consumer Internet traffic worldwide. Furthermore, this popularity increase is projected to continue in the years to come. Not only the number of services has grown, but nowadays a wide variety of devices are used to access these services as well, ranging from desktop computers and laptops to connected TVs, smartphones and tablets. Furthermore, the end-user requirements are continuously increasing in terms of minimum resolution, response time, etc. The key for a video streaming service to be successful is to meet these stringent quality requirements. Therefore, the quality as experienced by the end-user, denoted as Quality of Experience (QoE), is an important metric when it comes to the management of multimedia delivery services. Over time, the technologies used to deliver video streaming services have been subjected to change as well. While originally dedicated streaming protocols have been used, Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)-based streaming methods have gained a lot of popularity over the last years. This delivery type comes with several important advantages, such as the reliable transmission over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the reuse of standard proxies and caches and the seamless integration with firewalls. To cope with dynamic network conditions, HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) has been proposed. In HAS, the video is temporally split in multiple segments, each of which are encoded at different quality levels. At the client side, a rate adaption heuristic is applied to change the requested quality level based on, for example, the perceived network conditions, the buffer filling level and the device characteristics. In latest years, HAS has become the de facto standard for Over-The-Top (OTT) video streaming. Given the strong advantages of this approach, recently a lot of interest is gained in managed delivery scenarios as well. Despite the adaptive capabilities of HAS, due to the best effort nature of the delivery, quality oscillations and video freezes can still occur, negatively impacting the QoE. Historically, network resources have been strongly over-provisioned to avoid quality degradations. However, given the popularity of video streaming services and the increasingly stringent quality requirements, this is no longer economically viable. Therefore, efficiently managing the delivery of video streaming services becomes of utmost importance to provide high QoE to the end-users while simultaneously keeping the strain imposed on the underlying network resources under control. In this dissertation, multiple management solutions are proposed to optimize the end-to-end delivery of HTTP-based streaming services, both in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. The proposed approaches include server side, user side as well as in-network optimizations. A first way to improve the delivered service quality is to optimize the quality selection process at the client side. Even though the interfaces and protocol data of HAS are standardized in MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), a vast amount of commercial rate adaptation heuristics exist. However, state-of-the-art implementations are deterministic and hardwired to specific network configurations, making them unable to cope with a vast range of highly dynamic network environments. As a result, current rate adaptation decisions are often sub-optimal, regularly causing HAS streaming sessions to suffer from video freezing and low resolution video. Therefore, in this thesis, a selflearning quality selection heuristic is proposed. By using a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based technique, the HAS client continuously adapts its behavior based on the perceived network characteristics and buffer filling level. It is shown in this dissertation that this self-learning approach can significantly outperform current deterministic algorithms in terms of QoE in dynamic network environments. Besides client side approaches, in-network optimizations can be applied to increase the efficiency of the service delivery and to reduce the load on the underlying network resources. To restrain the pressure exerted on their networks by current delivery strategies, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have started to deploy so-called telco-Content Delivery Networks (telco-CDNs). This gives them more control over their resources by allowing content to be cached deep inside the ISP network. Furthermore, current advances in network virtualization enable ISPs to virtualize their telco-CDN infrastructure, allowing them to dynamically offer virtual storage and content delivery services to multiple third parties. Based on this scenario, a hybrid cache management strategy has been proposed, optimizing the capacity allocation, content placement and server selection across multiple tenants. By combining periodical proactive content placements based on popularity predictions with reactive caching capacity, the load on the ISP network can be reduced while simultaneously bringing the content closer to the end-user, positively influencing the QoE. The performance of a reactive caching approach strongly depends on the design of the cache replacement algorithms. As in HAS the video segments are delivered over HTTP, regular web caching algorithms can easily be reused. However, the characteristics of segmented video contain important information that can be exploited to improve the performance of the cache network. Therefore, cache replacement algorithms have been proposed, taking into account the temporal structure of a segmented video stream. This dissertation builds on this work by considering the fact that recently, a significant amount of users frequently watch multiple consecutive episodes of the same series in one sitting. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as binge watching. Based on this trend, an announcement-based caching strategy is proposed. By assuming that when a user is watching episodic content, the following episode will be streamed after the current one, the hit ratio of the caching network can be significantly increased, resulting in a reduced load on the underlying network resources. A final optimization approach proposed in this dissertation focuses on bringing deadline-awareness to the transport layer. Being delivered over TCP, HTTP-based streaming services compete for bandwidth with other types of services with different characteristics, following the fair-share paradigm. However, every byte in a video stream has an implicit strict deadline. If the data is not delivered to the client before it is needed to be played out, the video freezes, detrimentally impacting the QoE. Therefore, a deadline-based adaptation algorithm is proposed, based on a parametrized version of TCP New Reno congestion control. This approach only requires server-side adaptations at the transport layer and consequently is fully transparent for the rest of the network. It was shown that by taking into account the deadline information at the transport layer to dynamically adapt the aggressiveness of the TCP video stream, the QoE can significantly be increased in an HAS Video-on-Demand (VoD) scenario. The proposed approaches address important challenges currently perceived in segment-based video streaming services over HTTP by improving the quality delivered to the end-user while simultaneously restraining the load exposed on the underlying network infrastructure. Future research can build on this work by further focusing on new evolutions, both in terms of technology and user requirements. For example, the current adoption of new protocols such as HTTP/2 and their trend towards in-network encryption offers some interesting opportunities as well as important challenges when it comes to in-network service optimizations. Furthermore, the diversification of client devices and the increasing mobility of the end-users add to the requirements for video streaming services. Finally, novel networking paradigms such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) open up some new scenarios to add flexibility to the service delivery. However, the strong interplay between dynamic networking decisions and application layer approaches such as content placement and caching make this a challenging task.",

We are at a tipping point where more data is being produced than can be meaningfully processed. High value is contained in this data, as real-time processing allows advanced applications in domains like smart cities, pervasive health or industry 4.0. IoT data is challenging to process as it is heterogeneous, voluminous and produced at high frequencies. Semantic web technologies have proven to be ideal for the integration of these heterogeneous data. Semantic reasoning is able to derive high-level knowledge, enabling actionable insights. However, reasoning is too computationally expensive, compared to the velocity of the IoT data.\nThe objective of this proposal is to tackle these IoT challenges with Cascading Reasoning (CR), i.e. a layered reasoning approach consisting of various levels of complexity. CR naturally matches the edge processing paradigm, as the low complexity processing techniques can be pushed down to the edge. I will investigate highly efficient and scalable reasoning techniques that can deal with the velocity of the IoT. Furthermore, I will investigate how high-level queries can automatically be translated to the various levels of the cascade, allowing to translate Information Needs in a fully declarative way. Lastly, I will investigate how reasoning can be speed up by predicting certain steps.",

However, to cope with the need for interactivity during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, people have turned to traditional video conferencing tools, even if these have been deemed insufficient for an experience comparable to real interactions. The reason for not selecting AR/VR solutions is the physical discomfort that people suffer after wearing a Head Mounted Display (HMD) for a short while, i.e., cybersickness. Cybersickness symptoms range from reduced immersiveness, mild headache to nausea and vomit. Even if it affects about 90% of the AR/VR users, the topic has not broadly researched and only solutions tailored to specific cases have appeared. The purpose of CYBERNETIC is to design, develop and evaluate a generic cybersickness management system. To enable this objective, I aim to explore the subjective time perception theory, which states that humans perceive the duration of time differently depending on the activity pursued. Therefore, if the perception of time gets distorted, a feeling of mild discomfort occurs. This project will explore the link between subjective time perception and cybersickness.",

Recent technological advancements have made it possible to capture the three-dimensional world with e.g., visual cameras, light field setups and LIDAR. Using these devices, first research efforts have been made to enable the users to both move their head and change their position within a virtual scene. Because interaction with the content becomes more crucial, requirements in terms of latency and bandwidth are strongly increased. This, in turn, makes it difficult to maintain the user experience with state-of-the-art solutions. Because the 5G paradigm envisions bandwidths in the order of Gb/s and latency bounded by the speed of light, coping with these requirements becomes a question of processing rather than physical transmission. This project aims to tackle this challenge by means of two complementary research lines. First, this project will investigate how three-dimensional objects can be efficiently captured, encoded and processed, using data culling and network orchestration techniques. Second, the project will research networking protocols and solutions to efficiently stream the content to the end user, thus optimizing the user experience and reducing the latency within the end-to-end system. The proposed approaches will be evaluated through objective measurements and subjective experimentation.",

However, as IoT data is bound by the four Vs of Big Data\u2014volume, variety, velocity, and veracity\u2014deriving meaningful insights becomes challenging. Today, two approaches have been employed side by side. Relying on knowledge graphs (KGs) and logical rules, knowledge-driven approaches are able to derive new high-level insights via deductive inference. By making use of semantic enrichment, they are able to improve data quality and consolidate heterogeneous data sources. Conversely, data-driven approaches process raw data by applying a wide array of machine learning techniques to capture inductive knowledge. In order to leverage the benefits of semantic enrichment to improve performance on machine learning tasks, I propose using KG embeddings as a form of semantic feature generation. However, due to their static, relational nature, current embedding techniques are not easily applicable to streams of sensory data. To this end, I propose an incremental, schema-aware embedding technique, which is updatable in an online fashion and prioritizes sensory data. Because IoT applications are often critical and machine learning approaches are usually opaque with respect to decision-making, this technique is further integrated into an interpretable, end-to-end decision model.",

However, the current COVID19 pandemic has shown that they are not ready, as they do not fulfill the requirements in terms of immersiveness.

Therefore, this project proposes a user-centric approach on the assessment and modelling of immersiveness. Two dimensions are put forward: (1) Subjective and objective assessment of presence, cybersickness, usability and QoE and (2) Real-time modelling of immersiveness. Furthermore, a proof-of-concept is designed including two use cases. As such, this work will significantly advance the state of the art on immersive systems and multimedia in general.",

However, further research is needed to confirm that these methods can indeed replace existing mechanisms. In addition, novel networking paradigms have opened several possibilities for improving network performance, including higher flexibility and scalability. This research project tackles this challenge by pushing towards distributed cloud-native infrastructures to support low latency service delivery by integrating novel orchestration practices (i.e., Reinforcement Learning) with recent networking trends (i.e., Segment Routing, Intent-based Networking).",

This will be done only with the help of wearable sensors and a video to monitor the application. Examples of applications are tele-health or online gaming. Virtual Reality (VR) video streaming is best-suited to fulfill the immersive visual feedback loop. However, integrating VR in the Tactile Internet, which requires real-time transmissions, imposes improvements in the technology. The reason for this is that VR technologies require very high bitrates (~50Mbps) and suffer from large network delays (in order of the 100 ms). Additionally, it is very difficult to synchronize VR videos with the other sensors, and to assess how the services are perceived by users. The objective of this project is to tackle the challenges to bring VR up to speed with the Tactile Internet paradigm. We envision two research lines. First, in order to improve the transmission delays and bitrates, we will explore the limitations of the current transmission systems, optimize them and provide with alternatives. Second, we will focus on the multi-modal sensor integration and quality control of the systems to provide a real-time assessment of how the users are perceiving the services. All the methods proposed here will be evaluated both by measurements (delay, bandwidth,...) and by subjective feedback.",

Studying herbarium sheets involves significant manual labor, as they typically contain no morphological information about the specimens and their organs. Current herbarium processing methods are either not granular enough, inaccurate, or only work for a limited number of species. We aim to solve these issues by developing robust computer vision methods to process and analyze herbarium specimens. We will leverage the millions of publicly available herbarium images paired with taxonomic information to develop a novel vision transformer that generalizes to a broad range of species. We will use this model to fully segment herbarium sheets, producing specimen and plant organ masks (leaves, fruits, etc.). From these segments, we will extract morphological features that are crucial for understanding ecological contexts. Our existing expertise in this field forms the foundation for this research and we will use the novel digital specimen standards proposed in DiSSCo and TDWG. By applying our methods to millions of publicly available herbarium sheets and integrating the results into these repositories, we enable researchers to efficiently study historical biodiversity and environmental conditions.",

In order to cope with this issue, the FED-tWIN project will focus on the development of an end-to-end solution for the analysis, annotation and publication of the data contained in the collections and will try to offer a technical answer to a number of the challenges facing museum staff in the digital age. Fully understanding the end user\u2019s needs/tasks, defining the most important features to describe an artwork (and more specifically its composition), opening the relevant metadata in a standardized manner, and being able to perform federated queries across collections using natural language are the challenges that will be tackled in this long-term collaboration between the RMFAB and Ghent University\u2019s IDLab research group.In the initial years of their FED-tWIN collaboration, the RMFAB and IDLab UGent will join forces in a pilot project that focuses on automatic detection and annotation of saints in paintings. The project aims to cover not just the purely descriptive level of the iconography, but also the hidden meaning (the actual subject) of what is depicted. Such automations can greatly speed up the registrars\u2019 manual work process. In addition, these annotations will be linked with internationally standardised controlled vocabularies such as ICONCLASS within the RMFAB tailor-made wikibase. Both actions will help to increase the interoperability of the data contained in the collections and facilitate its digital dissemination and visibility among a large audience. In order to facilitate the retrieval of RMFAB collection items, end-user focused search mechanisms will also be investigated and evaluated. These tools will run on top of the wikibase and will support federated, intuitive querying in different languages.In the second research phase (after 5 years) the scope will be extended to the other sub-collections and infrastructures within the RMFAB. A tool will be developed to search all existing digitized RMFAB sources (various carriers/formats via data, text and image recognition) in one internal search. Furthermore, multimodal cross-collection linking will be supported in this phase. This effort should be seen as the first step towards making future data crossing possible between the Federal Scientific Institutions, and later expanding this at a broader national, European and even global level. Once this has been achieved, the way will be open to connect to international projects and achieve unprecedented research results and presentations.The proposed cooperation will raise the awareness of the usefulness of digital art history and of AI and the semantic web in the study and curation of digital heritage collections.",

However, long-range interactions between disparate areas of a protein sequence, imposed by the 3D structure, are generally not exploited yet in these models. Context-aware embedding models recently revolutionized the field of natural language processing, with long-range dependency modelling as a key feature, and promising results have also been obtained with similar methods applied to protein representation learning. \nWe aim to enrich such self-supervised embedding models by also training them for structural prediction, using publicly available protein structures. We will study how this can improve prediction performance on two structure-dependent downstream tasks. The first is protein secretability by yeast, a feature of high impact in fundamental biology and biotechnology. The second is kinase substrate site prediction, which is important in pharmacology. For both, labeled experimental datasets are available at the host lab, through novel experimental methods and novel data extraction methods. \nFurthermore, for proteins with known 3D structures, we will use attribution methods to map sequence- and structural input features that are learned as decisive factors by the models. In collaboration with the lab\u2019s experimentalists, we will verify the fragments of the human proteome that our model predicts to be secretable, and evaluate predicted secretability-enhancing modifications.",

The high-throughput method to study the protein content of a cell is using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and is acquired in a data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. This DDA approach is limited to the identification and quantification of a small subset of generally selecting the most abundant peptides. Data independent acquisition (DIA) allows for a more comprehensive view of the proteome because it does not put selection criteria on peptides and measures a wider variety of peptides at the same time. However, this makes the data analysis substantially more complex as it needs to be deconvolved. In this project proposal, I will describe a new, library-free DIA search engine that can nevertheless tackle the identification ambiguity problem. I will achieve this reduction of identification ambiguity by predicting even more aspects of peptide behavior than existing tools. In addition to leveraging these new predictive models, I will also optimize the scoring features extracted from these predictions. Moreover, the resulting identification ambiguity reduction should even allow for a more open modification search in DIA data, promising substantial impact on downstream biological analysis.",

While chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) allows for a high-throughput investigation of PTMs, bioinformatics tools to analyze the resulting data are lacking. Indeed, due to the large variability in potential PTMs or artefactual modifications, proteomics search engines suffer from a decreased identification sensitivity when including modifications into the search space. Deep learning models that accurately predict peptide LC-MS/MS behavior have shown to recover the identification sensitivity, although such predictors are limited to unmodified peptides. Very recent work by me and my colleagues on peptide retention time prediction has shown that deep learning models can generalize predictions across modified and unmodified residues. I therefore here propose to extend these methods to the prediction of peptide MS/MS spectra, enabling these spectra to be predicted for any peptide modification. Furthermore, by integrating the two prediction tasks and investigating more advanced deep learning techniques, I aim to push prediction accuracy to the limit of technical variance. I will also leverage these novel predictors for much increased identification sensitivity, and for improved localization of PTMs. Finally, I will apply these novel tools on a large amount of public proteomics data to generate the most detailed view ever of the proteome-wide PTM landscape.",

Smart latent thermal energy storage (LTES) coupled to heat pumps has been identified by the European commission as a key enabling technology.

However, this large volume of research has not lead to design methods since a fundamental understanding of the operation of transient heat exchangers is lacking. The present proposal describes sensible and latent TES systems based on a decomposition in energy fractions and a novel integration method of the heat transfer behavior of a representative unit volume. The result of this approach is a unified theory for testing and designing both LTES systems and phase change problems under constant boundary conditions. The knowledge developed in this project will allow researchers to define design models for LTES heat exchangers, to compare LTES heat exchanger geometries and to implement LTES systems in software for energy system simulation for techno-economic and life cycle optimization. By enabling the implementation of LTES heat exchangers in the energy systems underpinning our society, the results of the project will be a major step forward toward a sustainable future.",

State-of-the-art techniques often simplify the flow field or use global coefficients to calculate the forces on the yarn and/or represent the yarn as a smooth cylinder instead of taking its fuzzy or hairy texture into account. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop new simulation techniques that will enable the understanding of the interaction between air jets and a fuzzy yarn such that the energy consumption of the machines in the textile industry can be reduced. In the first work package, the focus will be on including the fuzzy texture of a yarn in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. To this extent, a multi-scale approach will be adopted where the boundary layer will be resolved on fiber scale in micro-scale simulations to extract local force coefficients. These coefficients then serve as input for a macro-scale actuator line model. The second work package focuses on the structural side where a beam element model for a yarn will be derived using multi-scale techniques as well. The third and final work package aims at combining these models into fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations of a complete yarn insertion.",

A leading role is played by the field of fluid-structure interaction, which investigates systems where flow and structural motion cannot be decoupled. Although these phenomena are widespread, their numerical simulation is only moderately used due to the tremendous computational cost and required expert knowledge. The high cost is caused by the iterative procedure within each time step and is aggravated by inherent numerical instabilities, increasing the number of the coupling iterations. In the state of the art, these instabilities are countered through the implementation of quasi-Newton methods, where the Jacobian of the coupled system is approximated based on previous subproblem evaluations. However, these techniques show important shortcomings, which this proposal intends to overcome by developing algorithms that automatically and dynamically set the subproblem solver tolerances, perform an automated classification and treatment of nonlinearities, and automatically learn the time-dependent behavior.

                "project_Description": "The design of airplanes or any wing-like applications involves shape optimization to maximize energy harvesting from a flow. Nevertheless, the final design must reach a compromise for several operating conditions. Morphing structures adapt their shape as a function of the environment and offer a broader range of optimal performances. Recent advances in the different fields of fluid-structure interaction have confirmed the feasibility of smart morphing wings. From the structural point of view, novel materials have opened the path towards flexible wings able to bear high loads. On the control and real-time optimization side, several machine learning methods have been shown to outperform other model-based methods. The final bottleneck towards the application of these technologies is thus the lack of numerical tools to test optimal morphing strategies, and an adequate optimization framework to learn these by imitating natural flyers. This thesis aims at bridging this gap, building on three main pillars: the development of the deformable overset meshing method, the definition of physics-based surrogate modeling for Micro Air Vehicles (MAV) aerodynamics, and the development of a bio-inspired optimizer. While the focus is kept on bio-inspired MAVs, the proposed methodology can find application in any aerodynamic applications involving the control of deforming bodies in motion.",

                "project_Description": "Steam generators and heat exchangers are omnipresent in industrial heating, chemical industry and power plants. These devices often consist of a cylindrical barrel filled with a bundle of long and slender cylindrical tubes. The barrel of a steam generator contains a mixture of water and steam and consequently the tubes in the barrel are surrounded by a so-called two-phase flow. Similar two-phase flows are present inside or outside the tubes in many heat exchangers.Despite decades of experience with building these devices, still yearly thousands of steam generator tubes have to be taken out of service by plugging them and ten thousands of tubes have to be repaired. Flow-induced vibration (FIV) causes a part of this damage but this phenomenon is not really understood for two-phase flow. Therefore, the aim of this fellowship is to reduce FIV of tubes due to two-phase flow inside or outside these tubes, with focus on flow aligned with the tubes. This will be achieved by performing and analyzing numerical simulations which take the coupling between the flow and the structural deformation into account.First, the forces due to two-phase flow around a single rigid tube and a rigid tube bundle will be calculated. Second, the effect of the structural motion will be included in the simulations. Finally, FIV due to two-phase flow inside a tube will be investigated. The results of all simulations will thoroughly be investigated to determine and understand the occurring phenomena.",

However, this impedes finding systems with concurrent optimal design and trajectory. To address this, multi-disciplinary integrated design methods \u2013 co-design \u2013 have appeared that treat design and trajectory optimization simultaneously. However, as yet, co-design has only been applied to low-fidelity models, that are cheap to evaluate but typically lack the ability to correctly represent reality. In this proposal I wish to push model-based system design further by including high-fidelity models, that more accurately capture the system\u2019s actual behavior but come at an increased computational cost. To do this, I introduce surrogate-assisted methodologies that possess the ability to include high-fidelity models in co-design. I intend to validate the new methodology by performing a model-based design of an unmanned aerial vehicle with the objective of enabling medical transportation beyond its current capabilities, that are presently limited by range. Furthermore, the methodological development will also enable the innovative design of e.g. airborne wind energy and break through the current barrier of several fields to accelerate the transition towards renewable energy.",

Our solution, called DCAP or Distributed Coordinated Access Point, is enabled by integrating distributed customized Wi-Fi 6 access points with the synchronous fronthaul technology developed in ERC ATTO. The following research innovations will be explored and demonstrated:\n1. Accurate time synchronization of the distributed APs with the Bit-Interleaved Sigma-Delta-Over-Fiber Fronthaul Network (BISDoF) as developed in the ERC Advanced Grant ATTO (No.695495). This novel fronthaul solution uses low-cost commercial optical transceiver modules connected with multi-mode optical fiber and is hence way more cost-effective and flexible than coaxial cables. A time synchronization accuracy below 10 ps is targeted.\n2. Low-latency operation of distributed APs by exploiting the new OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) feature in the Wi-Fi 6 standard and extending it with beyond Wi-Fi 6 and Wi Fi 7 capabilities in UGent-IDLab\u2019 open full-stack openwifi prototyping platform, with embedded wireless Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) capabilities.\n3. Full compliance of the highly customized APs with Wi-Fi 6 Commercial-Of-The-Shelf (COTS) clients.\n4. Distributed beamforming by coherently combining Resources Units (RUs) from multiple distributed APs, thereby adding an extra degree of flexibility and scalability to the system, as different RUs (subsets of OFDMA subcarriers) in the same channel can simultaneously serve different Wi-Fi clients. \n\u00a0\nBesides the technical evaluation of the DCAP proof-of-concept, the project will also explore potential valorization opportunities.

This way, the program contributes to a successful adoption of AI in Flanders. The ambition is for Flanders to occupy a strong international position in the field of strategic basic research in AI, and this within a strong and sustainable Flemish ecosystem.\nFive focus research themes have been selected: responsible AI, human-centered AI, sustainable AI (energy-efficient and high-performance), productive and data-efficient AI (systems that require little data, which perform by combining data with domain knowledge and experience of experts) and resilient and high-performant AI (robust against changes in the environment). The description of the work packages and their research tasks defines the aspects within these themes that will be investigated in the program. The AI solutions are demonstrated in real-life use cases. These results not only demonstrate the effectiveness, but also inspire companies for adoption and researchers for further research.\n\u00a0\nThe Flanders AI Research Program is part of the Flanders AI Policy Plan.

Current detection and diagnosis methods depend on expert interpretation of standardized ECG recordings taken during paroxysmal AFib episodes and risk scores from patients' electronic health records (EHRs), offering limited accuracy.  This project aims to develop novel approaches to predict the time-to-onset of AFib accurately. It will generate patient trajectories using a hybrid AI approach that incorporates features derived from a singular ECG or multiple follow-up ECGs, the patient's EHR, biomedical knowledge, biomarkers, and mechanistic simulation models of the heart. This exceeds the current state-of-the-art for AFib prediction which is limited to binary classification over a pre-specified time horizon.  The generated trajectories will be extended with new interpretability techniques and uncertainty quantification to identify precursors of future AFib, whose shapelets are unknown in the medical domain.  In summary, this project seeks to develop innovative solutions for detecting, screening, providing personalized treatment, and remote monitoring of AFib and other heart arrhythmias in a medical context by fusing new, advanced machine learning techniques with expert medical knowledge to improve patient outcomes.",

We thus observe a performance gap among languages, caused by a discrepancy in the amount of both (i) available training data, and (ii) research performed on these different languages. Due to this gap, a major part of the global population misses out on state-of-the-art NLP solutions. Recent multilingual language models are promising to reduce the discrepancy problem. Multilingual models are trained on a wide range of high- and low-resource languages simultaneously, enabling generalization of basic tasks across languages. However, it is not clear yet how to optimally exploit such multilingual models in advanced language understanding tasks (e.g., coreference resolution). Another promising direction is meta-learning, which is also gaining traction in NLP: inspired by human learning, it allows to adapt to a wide range of specific tasks given a few examples. Still, metalearning in NLP is mainly limited to monolingual applications. My PhD project will leverage the adaptive power of meta-learning algorithms to realize more efficient multilingual-learning for advanced NLP tasks. I will particularly focus on the task of coreference resolution to keep the scope manageable.",

As these technologies become more widely adopted, we will be surrounded by electronic devices that are wirelessly connected. Our lives will become increasingly dependent on the correct functioning of these very complex electronic devices. But, as these devices shrink, take on more functionalities, and are squeezed closer together, the likelihood that they interfere with each other will increase. This is because every electronic device emits electromagnetic interferences (EMI), while at the same time being potentially vulnerable to EMI coming from other devices. We simply must know more about how these devices are affected by EMI so that we can make the devices resistant to their effects. A technique known as \u201cEMI near-field scanning\u201d has shown tremendous potential for characterizing how EMI affects electronic devices. Unfortunately, the technique suffers from significant limitations - mainly it is just too slow. This research project will overcome these major challenges by devising advanced new methods based on multiple antennas and smart Bayesian AI algorithms that can characterize the effects of EMI much faster than we can today. These methods can make a huge leap forward in making our highly connected world more reliable, more effective, and more responsive to our needs.",

                "project_Description": "The immune system, a complex system consisting of many different cell types, is our body\u2019s main defense mechanism against all kinds of intruders. It plays a huge role in most diseases, either by battling the culprit in infectious diseases such as flu, or because something goes wrong with its functioning in immune diseases such as asthma. Determining the immune profile of patients can help to diagnose them or to follow their treatment, whereas studying in vitro immune cells or the immune system of laboratory animals is crucial in medicine development. To determine an immune profile, a high-throughput technology called flow cytometry is often used. Biological samples are stained with antibodies bound to fluorochromes and the cells in solution are passed through a fluidics system. Using an optics system including lasers and bandpass filters, the fluorescence emission of every individual cell is measured, which reports the presence of specific proteins or \u2018markers\u2019 on the cell surface, allowing to identify different cell types and giving insight in the immune profile of a patient. This technology can capture information of thousands of individual cells per second. The analysis of flow cytometry data will typically consist of multiple steps. First, some quality control steps should be executed, such as removing erroneous measurements caused by obstructions in the machine, dead cells or doublets. Some artifacts from the optics system need to be corrected as well, by compensating and transforming the data. Next, the different cell types can be distinguished. Traditionally, this is done by \u2018gating\u2019 the data, a procedure where subsets of cells are repetitively selected by drawing polygon shapes on two-dimensional scatter plots. Detecting the different cell types is rarely the final goal of the research. Often an additional analysis is executed on the cell type counts or percentages, to determine differences between patient groups or lab animals. In recent years, the number of markers that can be measured simultaneously has strongly increased. Whereas the original machine design in the seventies was only able to measure two colors and this increased gradually to twelve in the nineties, with the discovery of fluorochromes with smaller emission spectra and the advent of mass cytometry, this number increased to thirty and more in the last ten years. This causes the traditional way of analyzing this data to fall short. While for smaller datasets observing two parameters at a time was enough to identify the cell populations, this view is just too limited for high-dimensional datasets. It is not only time-consuming, but also very biased towards the expected populations. Many cells are \u2018gated out\u2019 and never analyzed, and rarely all markers are studied for a single cell. Additionally, as more and more cell populations can be detected, it becomes harder to identify which (combinations of) cell populations can be predictive for a clinical outcome. Machine learning, a branch of computer science in which models are learned from data, might help to tackle these problems. It has algorithms to handle highdimensional data (such as dimensionality reduction and feature selection), algorithms to select subpopulations in the data (called clustering) and algorithms to predict values, such as a group label or a survival time, from a description of a patient (classification and regression). Most of these machine learning techniques can find useful applications in flow cytometry research. In this work, we evaluate which algorithms are best suited for this type of data and develop several specific solutions for different use cases. The first chapter is a general introduction of the flow cytometry technique, showing its uses in immunology research and a short overview of machine learning approaches. In the second chapter, we develop a comprehensive visualization tool for flow cytometry data, as the traditional 2D scatter plots were incomplete, and alternative techniques such as SPADE and viSNE were not able to handle the millions of cells processed from flow cytometry samples. FlowSOM uses a self-organizing map, making it computationally very scalable, and includes an additional metaclustering step, allowing clusters in strongly varying sizes and shapes. The clusters from the self-organizing map are visualized in a minimal spanning tree, a view which has a very intuitive interpretation with the separate branches representing different cell types and the separate nodes in the branches representing small variations in a specific cell population. While the first version of the FlowSOM algorithm managed to give a comprehensive overview of a dataset, we soon noticed that it was not yet able to answer many questions of the immunologists without effort, such as \u2018What is the immunophenotypic difference between these two groups of patients?\u2019 and \u2018Which branch represents the dendritic cells?\u2019. In the third chapter, we describe some additional functionality that was implemented into the FlowSOM R package that is available on Bioconductor and that allows users to do a more complete analysis of their data without much extra work. The fourth chapter describes our participation in the FlowCAP IV challenge. The FlowCAP consortium provided a flow cytometry dataset of HIV patients with known progression time to AIDS, and were looking for cell populations which could predict this progression rate. We built a pipeline called FloReMi, which first applied extensive preprocessing to clean the files and then used a combination of the existing flowDensity and flowType algorithms to automatically detect many possible populations. We applied a supervised feature selection procedure to find populations of interest with minimal redundancy and the progression time was predicted using a random survival forest. Our final results outperformed the submissions of the other eight teams participating in this challenge. In the fifth chapter, a review of computational flow cytometry techniques is given, including the two techniques from the previous chapters and many other techniques developed in different research groups. Even though several algorithms exist, most people in the lab still use the traditional gating approach to analyze their data. It is necessary to introduce these new techniques to immunologists and to give them an overview of all the different approaches and their advantages, so they can make an informed decision about what could be worth learning to advance their research. Where all previous chapters focused on flow cytometry data, the algorithms could also be used in mass cytometry settings. Mass cytometry is a variation on flow cytometry where the cells are labeled with rare earth metals instead of fluorochromes. This circumvents the limitations of the optics system and allows the number of markers to go up to fifty and more. As mass cytometry is used more and more often in clinical studies, it is of utmost importance that the values are comparable between the different samples. To ensure this, samples are often processed per plate, but even then, batch effects might pop up between different plates. In the sixth chapter, we propose a new normalization procedure based on quantile normalization, which takes into account the cell type specific effects that might be occurring by incorporating the FlowSOM algorithm. In conclusion, we developed new tools for all steps of a flow cytometry analysis, going from preprocessing, over cell type identification up until prognosis prediction. Making use of machine learning techniques allowed us to improve compared to existing analysis tools and several of our methods have been adopted by other research groups. However, most people in the lab will not yet take the leap to start programming scripts. It will take some time until these new analysis tools are implemented in the commercial point-and-click solutions used by most immunologists. In the meantime, strong collaborations between wet lab teams and bioinformatics teams will keep pushing computational flow cytometry to a new level.",

                "project_Description": "Radio-frequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure characterization involves the determination of the levels of RF electromagnetic fields incident on humans in lab or real environments. The most important sources are antennas for broadcast and wireless telecommunication networks. Understanding the exposure of individual people to such fields over time is of crucial importance for studying health effects and checking compliance with norm and regulations. The classic exposure characterization methods are based on a massive amount of measurements in the streets which are very time consuming and expensive. To make it practical, the number of measurements is often limited to a small random set that can be executed in reasonable time, although this means that important variations in the field could be missed due to undersampling. One tries to improve the results by using prior knowledge of the environment;however\u00a0 this information is often inaccurate, unavailable or simply does not match with the reality.\nTherefore, reliable characterization of RF-EMF exposure is still an issue to be investigated.\nTo tackle this problem, a new methodology will be investigated that improves the reliability and cost-effectiveness of electromagnetic exposure characterization in a complex environment. This methodology will be based on an effective interplay of machine learning, surrogate modeling techniques, and optimization. So far, this approach is very innovative in the context of RF-EMF.",

Generative models are significantly more general than traditional discriminative models (e.g., polynomial chaos, neural networks, etc.) as they learn an approximation of the complete distribution underlying a collection of designs or topologies, hence they can produce completely new designs that satisfy the design specifications considered. The main idea of this research project is to integrate generative modeling into the design phase by studying, developing, implementing and testing new generative-based approaches for electromagnetic and electronic applications. Considering the huge differences in input/output behavior, frequency bandwidth and design constraints of different modern ICs, this research proposal focuses only on linear and passive systems. In particular, the key points of this project are: (i) Use generative modeling to learn and propose valid designs (indirect approach). (ii) Use generative modeling to directly generate valid designs that also satisfy the design requirements (direct approach). (iii) Characterize the effect of the manufacturing tolerances during the design phase in the generative modeling strategies. The proposed design framework aims at achieving short time-to-market and first-time-right design, which are fundamental in the highly competitive market of modern electronic devices.",

A crucial aspect to achieve this goal is to quantify uncertainty but - so far - that has been been largely neglected in machine learning. Bayesian methodologies incorporate uncertainty in a natural way. While they receive more and more attention, they still lack the accuracy or performance that one has come to expect from deep learning systems. The focus of this proposal is on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Stacking GPs (e.g., Deep GPs) and deep kernel learning enable more accurate modeling of complex-structured data. In Deep GPs the output of a higher level GP is fed as the input of a lower level GP. Deep GPs have shown some potential in many applications but are restricted to smaller data sets due to scalability. This restriction has led to the belief that Deep GPs are not applicable to very large data sets as used in other deep learning methods. In this proposal, we explore the use of Deep GPs and, in general, Deep Bayesian Networks for both discriminative as well as generative modeling of high-dimensional and complex-structured data. The key goals of this proposal are: (i) alleviate the computational complexity of the current methods through the development of novel variational bounds and by further exploiting parallelism in the model architecture, and (ii) using deep GPs or novel deep kernels to discover intricate patterns in data.",

First, we need to tackle the long tail phenomenon by giving special treatment to the many less popular items. This provides challenges in small-scale and sparse data regimes. Second, we need to tone down the harmful echo chamber effect: modern-day recommenders only suggest similar items without explicitly venturing the user out of his comfort bubble. We can achieve this by making recommenders more proactive. And third, new items and changes in a user's context and taste can lead to data distribution shifts. Recommenders should be designed to deal with such kinds of non-stationary data. In this project, I will leverage sequential generative models and active inference as tools to tackle the these research questions. The latter will allow for inherent tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation, such that more long-tail items are suggested and echo chambers are shrunk. Next, the generative model will enable planning capabilities in order to steer the recommendation process explicitly in a transparant manner. Finally, we will also look at how we can optimize the capacity of the generative model, either statically or dynamically. Evaluation of our work will be executed in real-life online settings, since offline evaluation is prone to unwanted feedback loops.",

All the approaches developed will be implemented with modern machine learning techniques and compared with state-of-the-art techniques from the literature.",

The generic support for scaling cloud components is currently limited, and the scaling logic is now located in the applications themselves (taking the decision to ask/decommission hardware andplatform components). The project proposal aims at realising an intelligent cloud middleware where the scaling intelligence is inherently provided by the middleware itself.

                "project_Description": "Data science is a field that has gained a lot of interest in the last few years, and has heavily influenced research and business practices. Many companies and organizations nowadays use data science to make better business decisions. Additionally, data science leads to new opportunities in the scientific community, not only to verify or disprove existing models, but also to consider problems from a totally different perspective and to model them at a much larger scale. For instance, detecting anomalies in monitoring data of equipment and software at an early stage may prevent failure of machines and software, significantly reducing costs. The main reason underlying the rise of data science is that almost every sector of the modern economy now has access to more data than was imaginable even a decade ago. IBM estimates that 90% of the global data today has been created in the past two years. Such very large sets of data are referred to as \u2018ig data\u2019and are often described using 4Vs: the extreme Volume of data, the wide Variety of types of data, the Velocity at which the data must be processed, and the Veracity of big data. In this dissertation, social media such as Twitter or Facebook play an important role. Social media are particularly promising for the field of data science, due to their large data volume, broad user base, and real-time nature. In the first place, social media can be used to discover information before it is picked up and stored in structured databases. Examples include the use of social media to detect events, even before they are reported in traditional media. Secondly, as social media form an important tool to attract new customers, it becomes increasingly important for companies and organizations to monitor, analyze and optimize the interactions on social media in relation to their brand, products, and ideas. A number of challenges arise when applying data science to social media data. In this dissertation, we address three major challenges. The first challenge we address is that social media content is often very short, noisy and diverse, and therefore very difficult to interpret automatically. For instance, more than 50% of the messages on Twitter do not contain useful information and are mostly random thoughts, self promotion or presence maintenance such as \u2018m back\u2019or \u2018ust watched TV\u2019 In other words, methods should be constructed that efficiently extract \u00a0the useful content from the very large and diverse social media data. As a first step to tackle this challenge, we propose an approach that discovers and characterizes places of interest using social media. In particular, we investigate how geographically annotated textual information obtained from Flickr photos and Twitter posts can be used to discover new places of a given type such as \u2018otel\u2019or \u2018chool\u2019to extend semantic databases of places. For several place types, our pro posed methodology finds places that are not yet contained in the databases used by Foursquare, Google, LinkedGeoData and Geonames. We have extended this work by introducing a method for discovering the semantic type of events which are extracted from social media. We have in particular focused on how the semantic type such as \u2018onference\u2019or \u2018port event\u2019is influenced by the spatio-temporal grounding of the event, the profile of its attendees, and the semantic type of the venue and other entities which are associated with the event. Experimental results show that our methodology can be used to discover events of a given semantic type which are not mentioned in the Upcoming datasets, by analyzing social media data. As our last contribution on structured information extraction, we consider the extraction of newsworthy topics from social media. The proposed method allows automatically mining social media streams to provide journalists with a set of headlines and complementary information that summarizes the current newsworthy topics. Independent evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Secondly, working with a large amount of real-time data requires distinctive new techniques and technologies. Frameworks should be developed to handle and analyze a large volume of data in real-time. In this dissertation, we propose a generic framework which can be used to monitor and analyze the consumption patterns of users on news websites. The framework monitors the popularity and features of online news articles in real-time, and can be easily scaled to handle millions of visits and thousands of articles. Our framework has been thoroughly evaluated on two quite different news websites: a young online news company that focuses on accessing readers through social media (newsmonkey), and the online platform from an established national broadcaster, with a more traditional take on news consumption (deredactie.be). We show that our generic data-driven framework and analysis approach are well suited for both use cases, and lead to new insights into online news sharing and consumption behavior. The last challenge we handle in this dissertation is to predict the popularity of media content (e.g., news articles) in social media. This is very challenging due to the high skewness in the popularity distribution and due to the very large and complex set of factors which influence the popularity. Therefore, advanced prediction methodologies should be constructed that can model the complex dependencies between the features of content and their final popularity. To address this challenge, we propose in this dissertation a novel methodology to model and predict the popularity of online news. We first conduct a thorough analysis of the view patterns of online news, and their underlying distributions. This knowledge is then used to better predict the popularity of articles, compared to various existing methods. By means of a new real-world dataset, we show that the combination of features related to content, meta-data, and the temporal behavior leads to significantly improved predictions, compared to existing approaches which only consider features based on the historical popularity of the considered articles. As most industries will become more data-driven, the applicability of our contributions will grow and the insights gained in this dissertation can form a sound basis for further research. For example, the online news monitoring and prediction framework has been deployed at newsmonkey and deredactie.be. The framework \u00a0\u00a0will also be made available for other news websites, to monitor and analyze their data and to optimize their strategy. In future research, the knowledge presented in this dissertation on consumption behavior of online news and its predicted popularity can be used to construct methodologies which actively suggest how the publishing strategy can be optimized.",

Mobile (semi-)autonomous robots are being used in an increasing number of domains and must adapt their behaviour to cope with dynamic and uncertain environments. The first part of this PhD will look into how the capabilities and resources of agents (i.e. robots, IoT sensors and IoT actuators) can be modelled and discovered. Agents will need to update the model based on their current state. This will form a critical framework that the rest of the project will build upon. Using the sensing capabilities of different agents the robot will formulate a plan to execute a task. As the plan is executed sections of the plan will be updated based on new sensor input. Combining agents\u2019 actuation capabilities will allow more demanding tasks to be executed, and increase the system\u2019s robustness. Multiple robots will collaborate to complete tasks, while trying to keep costs (e.g. battery and CPU usage, and task execution time) to a minimum. At each milestone experiments will be performed in real-world situations to evaluate how well the algorithms produced cope in uncertain environments. Through these incremental experiments data collection and analysis will be performed to allow conference and A1 journal publications to be produced.",

In this project, we propose computer architecture scale models: a novel methodology to predict the performance for large-scale general-purpose computer systems, both CPUs and GPUs. Scale models are scaled-down versions of the target system of interest. The key benefit of a scale model is that it is feasible to simulate using existing infrastructure. Extrapolation models are then employed to predict performance for the large-scale systems that cannot be simulated (or are impractical to simulate) using existing technology. The key challenges in this project are to (1) understand how system-level interactions (at both the hardware and software level) scale with system size, (2) devise scale models that are representative of the target system of interest, and (3) develop extrapolation models that are accurate, fast and easy to deploy. This project will propose and evaluate scale models for large multi-core CPUs (with multiple tens of cores) as well as high-end GPUs, and will consider a diverse range of workloads, including multi-program workloads, weak- and strong-scaling multi-threaded workloads and managed-language workloads.

We propose the Load Slice Core microarchitecture, a restricted out-of-order engine aimed squarely at extracting memory hierarchy parallelism, which, according to preliminary results, delivers a nearly 8 times higher performance per Watt per euro compared to an out-of-order core. The overarching objective of this project to fully determine the potential of the Load Slice Core as a key building block for a novel multi-core processor architecture needed in light of both current and future challenges in software and hardware, including variable thread-level parallelism, managed language workloads, the importance of sequential performance, and the quest for significantly improved power and cost efficiency. We anticipate significant improvement in multi-core performance within the available power budget and cost by combining chip-level dynamism to cope with variable thread-level parallelism along with the inherent power- and cost-efficient Load Slice Core design.

While programming languages have gone to higher abstraction levels to make programming easier and to make software portable, the cost is a loss in performance. This loss is exacerbated as machines have moved to multicore, and now to heterogeneous designs. The solution is to communicate software's organization and needs through the layers of the stack to help hardware deal with its limited resources, namely processors, caches, bandwidth, and power. We propose that we can use the VUB Software Language Lab's programming language and software development expertise together with the Ghent Performance Lab's expertise in the managed language runtime and performance and memory optimization fields, to develop new language interfaces and new virtual machine implementations. These will guide hardware on how to schedule parallel tasks, how to manage data movement on chip, and how to minimize power. Hardware can no longer achieve these goals with its limited low-level instruction information - we must use the dynamic, monitoring capabilities of high-level managed languages. Together, we can build a collaborative, vertically-integrated system that optimizes application scalability and performance on modern machines.",

                "project_Description": "Over the last few decades, we witnessed a spectacular evolution in processor design. Whereas 20 years ago, architects were building single-core processors with 100 million transistors at clock frequencies around 1.5 GHz, contemporary state-of-the-art processors can reach clock frequencies exceeding 4.5 GHz in a so-called turbo boost mode, and feature more than 24 cores, with multiple threads running simultaneously on the same physical core. Architects used the exponentially increasing number of transistors through Moore\u2019s Law to speed up single-threaded performance through various performance enhancements, including speculation, out-of-order execution, larger caches, etc. Nowadays, superscalar out-of-order processing is the defacto standard and improving single-threaded performance is becoming harder. Therefore, architects are using the available transistor count for scaling up the number of cores in a processor. By increasing the core count, the software architect is able to process data in parallel, thereby significantly increasing performance. But speculation, deeper and wider pipelines, out-of-order processing of instructions, etc. not only make processors faster, they also make them more complex. Due to the increased complexity, the need for fast and accurate tools to evaluate new processor designs is very high. The preferred tool, until now, for processor design has been detailed simulation. The level of accuracy for cycleaccurate simulation is very high, hence it may appear to be the perfect tool for taking important design decisions. However, since these simulators implement the design in great detail, they are also very time-consuming. This leads to impractical slowdowns when simulating long-running applications. To simulate long-running applications, architects can no longer rely on detailed simulators and hence need to use functional and/or sampled simulation. Unfortunately, even these simulation techniques become unfeasible when systems become too large or applications too long-running. Techniques such as analytical models are a good way to complement detailed timing simulations. These models predict the execution time using a mathematical model that uses inputs derived from a simple functional simulation. It does this while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The interval model [20] is one example that is based on the observation that, without miss events, the performance or instructions per cycle (IPC) of the processor pipeline should be equal to the width of the pipeline. This means that the processor is able to process instructions at its maximum IPC, e.g., at the designed dispatch width, as long as there are no miss events. This behavior is best observed at the dispatch stage, where instructions leave the front-end of the pipeline (after fetching and decoding is done) and enter the back-end, where the instructions are executed and all communication to memory is handled. The interval model models the impact of branch mispredictions, instruction- and data-cache misses. The interval model is able to provide a fast and accurate way for predicting application performance, but with a growing design space, even the recurring cost of re-running the functional simulations with different configurations becomes a major concern. Our approach to this problem is the use of a microarchitecture independent profiling technique, such that this profile only consists of application characteristics that are independent of the microarchitecture the application is running on. After building the profile, microarchitecture-specific inputs are generated based on a given hardware configuration, which enables the analytical model to predict performance. Constructing this profile is a onetime cost, thus the perfect solution for the exploration of large processor design spaces. The key challenge is thus to create microarchitecture-independent profiling techniques to provide inputs to the interval model. To model cache behavior, a tool called StatStack [18] can be used, which uses reuse distance histograms to predict the cache miss rate of an application for any cache size. Some prior work has been done to model branch behavior of an application, e.g., taken rate and transition rate [9, 24], and branch entropy by Yokota et al. [61]. Unfortunately, this prior work is not able to provide an accurate prediction of the number of mispredicted branches for a specific branch predictor. Therefore, a new, more accurate model is needed. We propose linear branch entropy, a novel metric that quantifies how regular the branch behavior of an application is. An entropy of 0 means that there is a regular pattern in the branch behavior. Therefore, these branches are easy-to-predict, leading to a low number of mispredicted branches. When entropy equals 1, this implies that there is a lot of randomness in the branch behavior, therefore these branches are hard-to-predict, leading to a high number of mispredicted branches. We keep this the same as the definition of Shannon entropy, but we adapt the entropy formula from a sum of logarithmic functions to a simple linear function, and we demonstrate that our new approach correlates better with how a branch predictor actually works. Because different branch predictors have a different misprediction rate for the same application, each type of branch predictor has its own model. We find that a linear relationship between entropy and the measured branch misprediction rate is the best fit. We use the following equation to calculate the misprediction rate M for a given entropy E: M(E) = \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u00d7 E. (2) Parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are calculated during a training run and are different for every branch predictor. We validate this new metric by predicting the misprediction rate for five branch predictors, e.g., GAg, GAp, PAp, gshare and a tournament predictor, for 95 benchmarks from two benchmark suites, SPEC CPU 2006 and CPB 2011. Across all modeled predictors, the average absolute error is around 0.70 MPKI and 0.89 MPKI for CBP and SPEC, respectively. The average MPKI equals 10.8, which means that the model features a relative error of less than 10%. The first use case of linear branch entropy is the ability to steer if-conversion. Linear branch entropy is an accurate metric for categorizing branches into hard-to-predict and easy-to-predict branches. This can be done on a per-branch basis and is thus an effective tool to profile branches to steer if-conversion. The impact of branch behavior on the overall execution time of an application is influenced by the number of mispredicted branches. When branches are very hard to predict, the branch predictor is not able to avoid most mispredictions. Thus, decreasing the branch impact should be done by avoiding this penalty, through if-conversion. By implementing this technique in the LLVM compiler, we improve performance by up to 2.4% compared to the default implementation of if-conversion. The second use case of linear branch entropy is the ability to provide inputs to the interval model to model the branch penalty. During the profiling run of the application, linear branch entropy is calculated. During the modeling phase, the model of the used branch predictor along with the entropy provides a prediction for the misprediction rate. From this, we can derive the number of mispredicted branches, which in turn, can be used to calculate the impact of all mispredicted branches. The use of linear branch entropy to model the branch penalty is used as part of the single-threaded model proposed by Van den Steen et al. [56]. In this model, the error of the branch component is only 1% compared to simulation, leading to a 0.16% error on the complete execution time, whereas Yokota\u2019s model, on average, leads to an underprediction of around 60%, or to a 7% error when predicting overall execution time. This microarchitecture-independent analyical model can predict the execution time of single-threaded applications, but in order to make the most out of current multicore processor hardware, applications need to adapt. Programmers can no longer rely on the computer architect to improve performance. Therefore, applications need to adapt and parallelize the work to utilize the available hardware to the best possible extent. This adds yet another dimension and even more complexity to the design of both the hardware and the software. To enable the software architect to adapt their applications to upcoming multicore hardware, and to enable the hardware architect to optimize this new hardware, they need new tools that enable them to do a fast and accurate design space exploration, and that give them the necessary insight into the possible performance bottlenecks. To tackle these new challenges, we propose RPPM, a micro-architectural independent modeling tool for rapid performance prediction of multi-threaded applications on multicore hardware. Multi-threaded applications create multiple worker threads that are able to execute in parallel. By dividing the work among these worker threads, the application tries to speed up the execution. But this comes with a cost and significant added complexity. These threads can and will interfere with each other, both directly through synchronization and indirectly through memory. The first major difference between single- and multi-threaded applications is the interference threads have upon each other through synchronization. The most used synchronization primitives include critical sections, barriers and producer-consumer relationships. These functions are available through parallel execution libraries, such as OpenMP, pthread, etc. Interference through memory can occur in many ways and can both lead to an increase or a decrease of the execution time. To model interference through memory, RPPM uses a new version of StatStack [1], that is able to predict cache miss rates for multi-threaded applications. To model multi-threaded execution behavior, we catch all calls to the synchronization libraries during the profiling phase, together with all characteristics needed to model per-thread behavior and multi-threaded memory behavior. To predict the execution time of multi-threaded applications, we first predict the execution time of all individual threads, between synchronization events. This is done by extending the single-threaded model with multi-threaded StatStack. The next step is to predict the overhead caused by synchronization, which is done by reintroducing all synchronization events and by modeling their execution behavior. RPPM predicts the execution time of all Parsec and Rodinia applications with an average absolute error of 11%. This significantly outperforms naive extensions of the single-threaded model that do not model any synchronization, leading to an average error of 28%. We also show that RPPM is a valuable tool to speed up design space exploration and to gain insight into the execution behavior of multi-threaded applications on future designs.",

However, the presence of sequencing errors in raw sequencing data challenges these applications to properly discriminate between true biological signal and sequencing noise. We believe that current methodology can be improved. The research question of this proposal is thus how to maximally exploit all information present in raw sequencing data to detect and correct sequencing errors. We propose a methodology to identify sequencing errors by not only looking at each individual position (e.g. using read coverage support, quality scores) but also at the context in which a putative sequencing error occurs. Raw sequencing data is often represented in a graph structure called de Bruijn graph. We will exploit a graph-theoretical property of these de Bruijn graphs and integrate multiple de Bruijn graph representations in a single framework to make full use of the contextual information. This additional contextual information will result in a highly dimensional dataset, but we posit that probabilistic graphical models are ideally suited to deal with this in a statistically sound manner. We believe our methodology will improve various bioinformatics applications such as read correction, genome assembly and variant calling",

Nevertheless, tools based on the FM-index encounter limitations when confronted with large collections of genomes, as their memory demands increase proportionally with sequence volume. This is particularly cumbersome in the era of pan-genome analysis, where the use of a single reference genome is abandoned in favor of large collections of genomes from multiple individual and/or related species.\nThe r-index has recently emerged as a significantly more memory-efficient substitute for the FM-index. It is particularly suited for pan-genomes. By employing compressed versions of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform and the suffix array, it achieves sub-linear scaling of memory usage relative to sequence volume. Practical reductions in memory requirements, exceeding a factor of 10, have been demonstrated.\nHowever, the r-index comes with a performance penalty. Various techniques have been suggested -also by our research group- to bridge this performance gap. To radically expand the utility of the r-index, we aim to leverage our research group's expertise in lossless approximate pattern matching using search schemes and compacted pan-genome de Bruijn graphs. Our overarching objective is to develop highly memory-efficient pan-genome graph representations based on the r-index and apply them to practical bioinformatics applications in microbiology and human genetics.",

Search schemes promise to decrease this performance gap and could even be faster. Additionally, our research group has already realized a software prototype. This prototype confirms the increase in performance. We propose to develop algorithms for faster lossless approximate pattern matching based on search schemes and bidirectional full-text indices by taking into account a) the repeat structure of the search text; b) the specific properties of the search pattern. We propose to apply these algorithms to 1) sequence alignments to a linear genome; 2) sequence-to-graph-alignments; 3) alignment of long erroneous reads.",

Because of the wide applicability of pan-genome data structures and functionality, we will develop scalable, graph-based pan-genome representations as well as algorithms that enable efficient search functionality. The main driving innovative factor for the search functionality is the detection of non-contiguous occurrences of reads against the pan-genome. By allowing jumps within the pan-genome graph when aligning a read to it, our algorithms will be able to infer the origin of a newly sequenced species as a mosaic composition of multiple, related species. A second goal for the search functionality is compatibility with long, high-error reads (Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore Technologies, which have error rates up to 15%) next to short, low-error reads (Illumina). We aim to accomplish this by developing novel seed identification algorithms to improve the seed-and-extend paradigm. Specifically, we will study pan-genome graph representations based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT), since they require little memory and support lossless approximate pattern matching due to recent algorithmic developments on bidirectional BWT-based indexes and search schemes.

Within Europe, the UK games (Jones and Spiegelhalter 2009) and the Scandinavian countries (Balint Dome et al. 2014), a pioneer in this field. In Belgium and Flanders in recent years made great efforts. The infrastructure associated with expertise and staffing will be increased gradually. Stakeholders are informed, motivated and shaped in this new component of quality care provision. Guidelines are developed evidence based. To achieve this by running with a care area for at least two phases. In a first phase, one identifies quality parameters in terms of structure, process and outcome, and verifies the measurability of the indicators; where necessary, set up for this purpose additional registration. In a second phase, the analysis of the indicators is worked out with the corresponding interpretation and reporting to the various stakeholders and target groups.",

These data are represented as points on the unit circle or unit sphere, since they have no \"length\". This renders their statistical treatment very delicate, as for instance the simple average of two points on the sphere will result in a point lying inside the sphere and hence not on the sphere. The classical mean thus cannot be used to describe such data, and more generally all statistical procedures must be adapted to these special data types. This has led to the research stream called Directional Statistics. In the present project, I will propose statistical models, in particular probabilistic distributions, to describe and deal with even more complex directional data. I will consider pairs of angular directions, leading to data on the unit torus, pairs of direction and a linear component, leading to data on cylinders, and toroidal/cylindrical data that moreover are spatially correlated, meaning that there is an underlying dependence structure. The new procedures allow me to tackle the data analysis in the following problems: 1) protein structure prediction, where the pairs of dihedral angles form data on the torus, 2) earthquake prediction, where the inter-occurrence time and magnitude form data on the cylinder, and 3) wildfire prediction, where the fire orientation and size are cylindrical data. Spatial dependence is present under 2) and 3).",

The proposed project aims to fill this lacuna and will create the first morphosyntactically annotated and parsed corpus of the European Spanish dialects. This dialect corpus will be designed in a geographically balanced way and its material will proceed from the COSER corpus (Corpus Oral y Sonoro del Espa\u00f1ol Rural `Audible Corpus of Spoken Rural Spanish'), which is the largest collection of oral data in the Spanishspeaking world but which remains largely un-transcribed. As transcribing and annotating are expensive and laborintensive, this project takes a respeaking and collaborative game-based approach to building the parsed corpus of European Spanish dialects. In other words, we intend to obtain automatic transcriptions using a speech recognizer. These will then be processing using Natural Language Processing tools and can then be used to create a crowdsourced game through which members of the public contribute to the co-creation of the parsed corpus by providing annotations in the context of a game.",

Nonetheless, terms often contain essential information and a good comprehension is imperative in many contexts (e.g. medical texts, technical manuals and legal documents).\u00a0 Not only human translators face this problem, but machine translation (MT) as well.\u00a0 MT is typically based on enormous volumes of texts (mostly human translations), but terms are inherently much rarer than general vocabulary and very domain-specific as well. Therefore, a different approach must be adopted to handle terminology: automatic term extraction (ATE). Monolingual ATE was developed to recognise and extract terms from running text. Next, a translation component was added using parallel corpora, where terms can be extracted from aligned human translations and then linked to their potential equivalents in the target language. However, sufficient domain-specific parallel corpora cannot always be found, especially for smaller domains and languages. The latest innovation is multilingual ATE from comparable corpora (ATECC). Collections of similar texts on the same subject in different languages (but not translations) are used to, first, perform monolingual ATE and, then, find translation equivalents in the lists of extracted candidate terms. Comparable corpora are a solution for the data acquisition bottleneck because they are much easier to collect. However, finding translation equivalents becomes much harder, because the texts aren\u2019t aligned, so the position and even presence of translations is unknown. This PhD project aims to investigate a single, holistic methodology for ATECC. In accordance with the most successful trends in natural language processing, special attention will be paid to machine learning and deep learning approaches. In preparation, several comparable corpora have been collected and annotated to provide data. Every aspect of ATECC will be researched, from data collection (what is the impact of the corpus?), to monolingual ATE (can a bottom-up approach based on human term annotations shed light on the ambiguous characteristics of terms?), to bilingual term linking (how can the most informative different strategies for bilingual alignment be combined?), to evaluation (how can an informative gold standard be constructed for ATECC?). Finally, this approach allows an exploration of potentially beneficial interactions between the different components. In conclusion, the goal of this project is to use a holistic, bottom-up approach to investigate the best strategies for automatic term extraction from comparable corpora.",

However, because their linguistic resources are limited, they often merely cut-andpaste\u00a0fragments from source texts, which leads to cohesion problems and excessive textual\u00a0borrowing. While there is a clear need for guidance, providing formative feedback on writing is\u00a0time-consuming. It is therefore highly relevant to investigate the potential of automated systems\u00a0to foster student\u00b4s awareness of the necessary strategies. In this vein, Automated Writing\u00a0Evaluation has received growing interest. The advance in Natural Language Processing (NLP)\u00a0technologies has paved the way for the development of tools that analyse text features based on\u00a0corpus-linguistic research.\u00a0Automated Writing Evaluation to date has received little attention within the German L2 research\u00a0community, although the required NLP resources are at hand. The project aims to fill this gap by\u00a0investigating the cohesive devices used by German L2 writers based on interlanguage theory,\u00a0developing an e-tutor based on the results that specifically targets their cohesion and rephrasing\u00a0strategies, and thoroughly evaluating its added value in higher education.",

Our project aims to tackle the lack of connotative common-sense knowledge (viz. emotions) in text-based dialogue systems. We will therefore (i) implement novel machine-learning models to detect explicit and implicit fine-grained emotion trajectories, and (ii) generate appropriate response strategies for the detected emotions. To bridge the gap between research and industry, we focus on domain-specific conversations in Dutch and English customer service. First, we will compile real-life and synthetic corpora of textual dialogues. Subsequently, we plan to design a novel emotion-detection pipeline that dynamically tracks emotions through these dialogues by incorporating knowledge about events, intents, and response strategies. The output of the pipeline will be used in a generation component which automatically transforms factoid responses in emotion-rich replies to mitigate the emotions of customers towards a more positive sentiment. Our final system will be validated in terms of portability and utility by implementing it in two real-life use cases.",

While sentiment analysis systems perform well at identifying explicit sentiments, they have a hard time inferring implicit sentiments or identifying non-evaluative words that evoke a particular sentiment within a text or a sentence. The reason why is simple: automatic systems, compared to human beings, do not possess any common sense or world knowledge to decipher hidden meanings which renders them unable to create links with the world around them. Instead, computers can only rely on what they have learned from specific data. The presence of irony is a prime example of implicit information that an automatic system is unable to fathom. Transplanting this so-called human commonsense knowledge to a system and being able to allow it to finally grasp implicit sentiments would signify a real breakthrough in any field related to NLP. This project aims to address the challenge of modelling implicit or prototypical sentiment in the framework of automatic irony detection for Dutch.",

In standard sentiment analysis, only explicitly expressed sentiment is detected (\"This movie is fantastic.\") and current systems do not not handle common-sense implicit sentiments which is connotationally attached to certain events or situations. For instance, \"Motorola sees an increase in revenue\" implies a positive sentiment towards the company.

As the system\u2019s performance is dependent on the kind of data it is trained on (e.g. the language, domain and label set used for annotation), every shift to new data implies a new annotation effort. This process is not only arduous, but also inhibits progress in multilingual NLP. The focus in this project is on emotion detection for Dutch, for which currently no annotated data are publicly available, and on exploring transfer learning techniques to allow for cross-language transfer. In transfer learning, the aim is to transfer information from previously learned systems to novel tasks, reducing the needed amount of training data. By reusing information from English systems for Dutch emotion detection, we aim to tackle the data acquisition bottleneck and investigate whether language-independent emotion features can be learned. Moreover, we will investigate transfer across domains and label sets. This will result in a flexible Dutch emotion detection methodology which can be applied to various use cases. We will explore one such case by automatically detecting real-life emotions that emerge during crisis situations.",

Yet, spoken (dialect) corpora are indispensable for a better understanding of language structure, language change, interaction, and the limits of variation in human language. Given rapidly progressing dialect loss, the transcription of existing audio collections is urgent, as is their linguistic annotation. The proposed infrastructure represents a significant geographical extension of the parsed corpus of spoken Dutch dialects (GCND) currently under construction at Ghent University, to cover the entire European Dutch dialects area. The entire infrastructure will comprise ca. 10mio. tokens. (2) Dialects and regional speech still hamper the accuracy of language and speech technologies, which are increasingly used in all areas of daily life. The current project will use the existing audioaligned transcriptions and annotations from the first stage of the GCND to re-train ASR and NLP tools to speed up the transcription and annotation of the new data.

A trend that will only become more prominent with the recent advancements of generative AI, with ChatGPT as its most famous representative. While this technology can assist during writing tasks, it lacks the core skills necessary for qualitative writing, such as creativity and critical thinking, and therefore cannot replace human writing skills. Research shows that these skills benefit from detailed corrective feedback. Even in ideal circumstances, this task is labour-intensive for teachers, but it becomes even more challenging when considering the growing teacher shortage in Flanders. This project aims to provide a possible solution by developing an AI-based Dutch automated writing support system. The envisioned system will not only be able to correct low-level writing problems, such as spelling and grammar errors, but also to provide feedback on more complex writing issues on the text level. In order to achieve this, I will (i) improve upon existing writing support systems to detect and correct low-level errors, (ii) explore novel AI methods to enable the evaluation of text-level errors and (iii) exploit generative AI to give more meaningful feedback. The core aim of this project is to end up with a writing support system which is able to not only detect and correct writing errors at various text levels but also to motivate writers with the right feedback at the right time.",

However, network planning is currently already a very complex problem due to the many targets such as cost, performance, etc. To meet the requirements of the next-generation networks, network should be taken to the next level. Future network design should be EMF- (Electromagnetic Field) and energy-aware, but also have a high degree of flexibility. 5G for example will use a variety of technologies in a single network such as beam forming, mmWave frequencies and Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) requiring advanced machine learning techniques to deal with this network complexity and ensure the energy- and EMF-awareness. For energy-awareness, one should also look at using renewable energy sources to feed the wireless access network instead of using fossil fuels like today. Finally, to allow a high degree of network flexibility, one should use mobile base stations. This can be done by UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) aided networks. In this type of networks, mobile stations are mounted on UAVs or drones to provide additional performance on a more local scale. \nEach of the above requirements will be addressed in this research proposal.",

                "project_Description": "In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of `smart' wireless devices, including smartphones and tablets, Wi-Fi networks and everyday objects connected to the internet. This has caused the demand for radio spectrum to increase dramatically, driven by the growing quantitiesof data transmitted over the internet by these devices. In Europe alone,the European Commission estimated in 2017 that the total value of servicesthat depend on radio spectrum is at least 200 billion euros annually. Therefore,it is crucial that new technologies should aim to increase the eciency with which the radio spectrum is being used. As such, researchers aim to model the medium between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna as best as possible. This medium is called the radio channel, and it is responsible for all the changes of the characteristics of a wireless signal as it propagates from the transmitter to the receiver. Due to several interactions with physical objects in the environment, a multitude of signals will arrive at the receiver, subject to dierent propagation echanisms such as reection, diraction, and scattering. This phenomenon is called multipath propagation, and the result thereof is that dierent propagation paths will have dierent characteristics. The aim of channel modeling is thus to make a mathematical representation of the eects of the communication channel through which the wireless signals are propagating. By using an accurate channel model, we can provide a realistic assessment of the overall performance in the design of applications and communication systems, and optimize link performances and data rates.\n\n\n\nTo overcome the limited availability of the radio frequency spectrum, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems have emerged as the most promising technology to multiply the capacity of a radio link. MIMO systems use multiple antennas at the transmitting and receiving stations, exploiting the multipath propagation in an environment. An observation of the MIMO radio channel can be modeled as the superposition of a deterministic part (the Specular Multipath Components (SMC)), a stochastic part (Dense Multipath Components (DMC)), and additive measurement noise.\n\n\n\nThe SMC consists of a number of plane waves with well dened parameters in the dimensions in which the radio channel is expressed. They can be described by their Angle of Departure (AoD) from which they are emitted xxxii English summary by the transmitter, the Angle of Arrival (AoA) from which they are incident at the receiver, and the Time-delay of Arrival (ToA) they have encountered, proportional to their traveled path length from transmitter to receiver. The DMC originates from distributed diuse scattering of the electromagnetic waves on electrically small and rough surfaces. As their contribution to the radio channel is often non-coherent, meaning that their phase is not a deterministic quantity, they can only be described in a stochastic manner.\n\n\n\nThis means that they contain some kind of randomness, such that we typically model them by means of the covariance matrix of the residual signal components, which is the remainder of the radio channel after removal of the SMC. The DMC are typically modeled both in the frequency domain, and the angular domain. The inclusion of DMC in channel models is often lacking in literature nowadays, although it has already been shown that their contribution to the total capacity of the MIMO radio channel can be quite signicant.\n\n\n\nIn this work, we will focus on stochastic empirical channel models, meaning that we will derive channel models consisting of the coherent contributions of the SMC, with the inclusion of the non-coherent contributions of the DMC, through experimental results based on channel sounding measurement campaigns in specic environments. We will do this with a focus on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) communication systems, characterized by their ability to transmit pulses with a very low power density in a large frequency band, ranging from 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. As such, this allows these systems to share the radio spectrum with other applications, after which their combination with a MIMO antenna conguration vastly increases the capacity of these communication systems. Chapter 1 explains these concepts in more detail.\n\n\n\nTherefore, we will examine the importance of accounting for DMC in conventional channel models in Chapter 2, which covers an analysis of the DMC contributions in an oce environment, a laboratory environment, and a large industrial hall. In this chapter, we will analyze both their frequency and polarization-dependencies, and we will check the validity of the DMC assumption for higher frequency bands. Afterwards, Chapter 3 presents the design of a newly developed multipath estimation algorithm, allowing for the frequency-wise analysis of propagation paths throughout the UWB frequency band. Subsequently, this algorithm is used in Chapter 4, where it is applied in a novel localization framework, employing a riangulation method using the geometrical properties of the propagation paths such as the aforementioned AoD, AoA and ToA. Whereas these chapters all focused on the analysis of DMC in the frequency domain, we will go a step further in Chapter 5, where we analyze the DMC in the angular domain. To facilitate this, the maximum likelihood estimation of the DMC parameters is extended from the conventional unimodal DMC assumption to a multimodal DMC assumption. As such, we are able to characterize diuse scattering from multiple angles in an environment. The validity of our approach is tested English summary xxxiii by means of the generation of synthetic radio channels, and is evaluated in an indoor hall environment. Next, Chapter 6 concerns an analysis of the delay-Doppler characteristics of the radio channel in a university hall. This environment is analyzed during several short and long breaks in-between classes, so that the Doppler characteristics could be analyzed in the timedelay domain as a function of the occupational density of the hall (i.e., as a function of the amount of people present in it). Finally, Chapter 7 concludes this book with a summary of the accomplished work, and proposes some opportunities for future research.",

These favourable properties make UNMOD a promising alternative to state-of-the-art electrical neurostimulation technologies, that require surgery to reach deep targets (deep brain stimulation) or are restricted to centimeter resolution for cortical non-invasive stimulation (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation or direct current stimulation).\nHowever, the main drawback of UNMOD is that its underlying physical and biological mechanisms are not well understood, precluding application-targeted optimization of the ultrasonic waveform and limiting the interpretability of experimental ultrasonic neuromodulation studies. Several tentative underlying mechanisms have been proposed with varying presence of an accompanying mathematical framework: e.g., intramembrane cavitation, mechanosensitivity, acoustic radiation force, etc. Furthermore, most likely interaction between multiple mechanisms should be accounted for in order to describe ultrasound-evoked neuronal effects.

This research proposal aims at keeping pace with the ongoing evolution in wireless telecommunications, such as the introduction in of Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) and beamforming in the fourth generation (4G) technology Long Term Evolution (LTE), and their anticipated widespread use in 5G New Radio (NR). As RF-EMF exposure becomes more user-dependent, current measurement methods are too static, too short, and/or ignore the user dimension. The first two concerns (static and short-term) will be mitigated by designing extensive, static as well as mobile, sensor networks that continuously monitor environmental RF-EMF. The third issue (user dimension) is expected to become a dominant factor with the introduction of 5G NR. Hence, new measurement methods are required depending on technological advances and possible novel use cases introduced with subsequent releases of 5G NR. Moreover, as the collected measurement data are expected to be numerous (millions of data points) and of heterogeneous origin (different measurement devices), artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning techniques and stochastic methods will be explored. The combined objectives of this proposal will lead to a better characterization and a better understanding of our current and future exposures to RF-EMF in the urban environment.",

The objective of this research proposal is to investigate the possibility of using a combination of electrical and acoustical stimulation to target the deep brain nuclei non-invasively. The main idea is to combine the advantages of two different types of neurostimulation to make non-invasive deep brain stimulation possible. While electrical stimulation is more effective to activate excitable tissue, acoustical simulation has higher spatial accuracy.

To avoid interference with these legacy services, the transmit power per hertz of the UWB system is very low and must satisfy a mandatory predefined spectral mask. When UWB is combined with the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) principle, that uses multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver, the UWB system becomes suitable for extremely high data rate short range communication, as e.g. wireless printing of digital pictures without the need of a PC, wireless televisions and monitors, etc. Reliable data detection in MIMO-UWB systems depends on the possibility to accurately estimate transmission parameters related to the channel and synchronization. Further, interference from legacy services operating in the same frequency band as the MIMO-UWB system must be suppressed. However, because of the huge bandwidth and low transmit power of the UWB signal, this parameter estimation and interference suppression is not trivial, and requires the development of advanced signal processing algorithms. An issue in the receiver design of a MIMO-UWB system is the absence of realistic channel models. Therefore, in this project proposal, we want to develop new realistic channel models for MIMO-UWB, based on measurements, which we can use in the derivation of new advanced signal processing algorithms.",

By leveraging the technological know-how available in Flanders, combined with a joint effort to make speech data available for the development of speech technology, tailor-made speech solutions can be provided at reasonable cost, a cost that medium and small companies can bear. Our research results will be validated on other languages as well and should be readily applicable to other (European) countries with similarly diverse language variation and market (e.g. Switzerland, France, Italy, Poland, ...). The project outcomes include (1) open source tools and publications describing the underlying technology, (2) a public repository containing the collected data (speech, annotations, and pseudo-annotations, with a focus on the more challenging speech data such as spontaneous speech, dialects, and speech form non-natives) that can be made publicly available, (3) a private repository containing the data which is only available for research by trusted parties, (4) a web-service to allow citizen and companies to donate additional speech for either the public\nor private repository, (5) models for open source speech recognition toolkits which are made available to (local) industry, and (6) webservices built on top of those models and toolkits to provide easy access to a baseline automatic speech transcription setup.",

SOTA mental health research is focused on finding relationships between affective states and physiological responses. However, transitioning this knowledge to real-life settings poses several problems; (1) physiological responses do not solely depend on mental health, (2) people can be subject to intra-user variance, and (3) machine learning models are mostly black-box and therefore give little to no insights. I will tackle these problems by constructing a multimodal and dynamic hierarchical sensing framework for personalized (mental) health monitoring in real-life. Multimodal sensing will be used to detect non-physiological symptoms and thus incorporate context. The multimodality of incoming data streams will be handled by this hierarchical framework, where dynamic questioning enables capturing intra-user variance. By fusing hierarchical anomaly detection with behavior modelling, using an active learning approach, I will determine the optimal moment to gather user feedback. Finally, I will focus on providing sensible insights to both physicians and patients using expert knowledge.

No high-quality, real-time technology is available for camera-captured content providing 6-DoF video. A few techniques have been designed that allow for free viewpoint video. However, either viewpoint interpolation is hard and lacks quality, or suitable real-time compression does not exist.\n\nAt the Ghent University, in cooperation with TU Berlin, a novel framework is being developed to tackle the compression of light field video. The major advantages are real-time rendering and elegant mathematics, which allow for high compression ratios. However, the encoding process is still extremely slow and the resulting image quality is often lacking detail in high-frequency regions. The proposed research will fix these two issues: boosting image quality to industry requirements, and making the compression significantly faster.\n\nI plan to do this iteratively with an increasing level of complexity. Firstly building fundamentals on 2D images, and slowly moving on to the higher dimensions, required for 6-DoF. Along the way, I will maintain the decoder counterpart, such that there is permanent validation: is everything still fast enough for real-time viewing? In summary, I will push the novel framework to industry standard requirements to make 6-DoF experiences come to live.",

The only type of content currently suitable for VR, consists of low-quality renderings of simple 3D models.\nA new type of content is on the rise: by using camera captures of the real world, photorealism can be achieved at low rendering effort, e.g. 360\u00b0 video in VR. To achieve total freedom of movement, many cameras are placed in the scene and the views in between cameras are interpolated through \u201cview synthesis\u201d.

Realism will be achieved by an innovative approach that models the probability of each pixel being \u201ccorrect\u201d via camera positioning and the likelihood that the pixel belongs to a reflective surface. The framework will include a real-time visualizer to assess the achieved quality and performance on many existing and new data sets.\nWith this framework, the door to hyper-immersive, photorealistic VR in real-world settings will be opened, allowing the wide public to travel back in time to any camera-captured place on earth.",

However, this freedom means that large parts of the visual content remain invisible (such as objects behind the viewer) or are hardly visible (due to peripheral vision), physically limiting the amount of information perceived at any point in time. Additionally, exploration of the scene is constrained by the physical limitations of a viewer\u2019s body such as movement speed and the angles at which their head can explore the scene. Consequently, the goal of this project is to use both my knowledge in quality of experience and data compression to transform these physical limitations into fundamental knowledge, by investigating the minimal subset of visual information that humans can perceive when engaging with interactive immersive content. This knowledge can then serve as the crucial foundation for future technology to drastically decrease the amount of information that needs to be coded and transmitted to an end-user, and to design effective data representations that facilitate the interactive delivery.",

If security measures fail and an untrustworthy employee distributes this media, the agency wants to identify the source of the leak. Therefore, it should send a personalized version of the video to each user, who is identified by a watermark hidden in his or her version. When someone illegally redistributes such a version, the agency extracts the watermark in order to identify the leaker. Existing watermarking schemes face problems of scalability, imperceptibility or robustness and do not focus on 360-degree video yet. As a solution, I will develop a novel watermarking approach based on new, personalized streaming technologies. In these technologies, content providers deliver a personalized experience to the users by adapting to their network conditions and position of the viewport in a 360-degree video. In my master\u2019s thesis, I laid the foundation for a watermarking scheme using a video encoder made for personalized streaming. In this research project, I will improve this technique and adapt it to 360-degree video. Additionally, I will expand the concept such that it skips an explicit watermark embedding step entirely. Instead, it will identify the user based on the way in which the media was personalized. In conclusion, I will enable media providers to simultaneously deliver a personalized experience and protect their content when traditional security measures fail.",

Thus, the increasing availability of archival and library collections as data (information in machine-readable format) enables the use of new approaches and thus digital tools. This is both a challenge and an opportunity, since the majority of researchers in the humanities are not proficient in computer science, computational linguistics, statistics, etc. Thus, there is a significant gap that needs to be filled in order to provide services that facilitate this research. This requires expertise in various aspects of the digital research cycle, from the compilation of corpora to analysis, virtual exhibitions and the archiving of research data. The GhentCDH is an interdisciplinary research and service centre that facilitates and reflects on the use of these digital research methods in the human sciences. A team of computer scientists, linguists, data scientists, interdisciplinary 'digital humanists' and public historians is clustered in four focus areas: 1. Collaborative databases and Linked Open Data 2. Digitisation, (pre)processing and digital text and image analysis 3. Digital heritage, participation and virtual exhibitions Within these four focus areas, cooperation takes place with other actors inside and outside UGent, respectively within UGent with LT3, IDLab, MICT, the Quetelet Center and the Institute for Public History. The GhentCDH is involved in various infrastructure projects on a national and international level, mainly through the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities - DARIAH network and the Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure - CLARIN network, and the Flemish contribution to the European research infrastructures DARIAH and CLARIN - 'CLARIAH-VL Open Humanities Service Infrastructure' project (FWO International Research Infrastructure), which is coordinated by the GhentCDH.

In an era where digital discourse shapes societal attitudes, it is imperative to address the rising tide of stereotypes targeting queer people. These stereotypes can escalate into hate speech and violence, perpetuating discrimination. RAINBOW's objective is to preemptively counteract these stereotypes, fostering a more inclusive and tolerant online environment. While much research exists on hate speech detection, there is a significant scarcity of initiatives that focus on early intervention to prevent stereotypes from evolving into hate speech and violence. The project seeks to fill this gap by pioneering advanced Multilingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques specifically tailored to recognize and counteract emerging stereotypes and biased narratives (in English, Spanish and Italian). This proactive approach, combined with collaboration across linguistics, NLP, sociology, and queer studies, offers a comprehensive understanding of the issue and the development of tools to address it effectively. Furthermore, the findings of this project will play a pivotal role in the development of an Educational Toolkit specifically designed to raise awareness about stereotypes and biases directed at LGBTQIA+ individuals. This tool will be tailored for the age group that spends the most time online (16-24 years old), ensuring that the next generation is equipped with the knowledge and understanding regarding AI technologies and to foster inclusivity and combat stereotypes in the digital realm. Essentially, the RAINBOW project aims at establishing a safer online environment for LGBTQIA+ individuals while advancing the frontiers of Multilingual NLP technology to combat online discrimination.",

                "project_Description": "Despite the major advancements in the domain of sentiment analysis during the past few decades, automatically modelling implicit sentiment still remains a major hurdle in the field. While sentiment analysis systems perform well at identifying explicit sentiments, they have a hard time inferring implicit sentiments or identifying non-evaluative words that evoke a particular sentiment within a text or a sentence. The reason why is simple: automatic systems, compared to human beings, do not possess any common sense or world knowledge to decipher hidden meanings which renders them unable to create links with the world around them. Instead, computers can only rely on what they have learned from specific data. The presence of irony is a prime example of implicit information that an automatic system is unable to fathom. Transplanting this so-called human commonsense knowledge to a system and being able to allow it to finally grasp implicit sentiments would signify a real breakthrough in any field related to NLP. This project aims to address the challenge of modelling implicit or prototypical sentiment in the framework of automatic irony detection for Dutch.",

For the GCND, the\u00a0recordings are transcribed \u2013 urgent in times of rapidly\u00a0progressing dialect loss! \u2013 using a newly developed two-tier\u00a0protocol, and linguistically annotated (i.e. with information\u00a0on the word class of the individual words (\u2018postags\u2019) and the\u00a0syntactic functions of word groups (\u2018parsing\u2019)) using existing\u00a0software tools. Compared to other data collections on\u00a0Dutch dialects, the GCND will be unique in being based\u00a0exclusively on spontaneous speech. As the dialect\u00a0recordings represent a historical stage of the language (in\u00a0the case of French-Flemish even the last witness of a now\u00a0all but extinct language variety) and will now finally be\u00a0searchable for word forms and syntactic patterns, the\u00a0GCND will (i) make it possible to track language change\u00a0through time and space, (ii) enable a new perspective on\u00a0the functional strength of dialect features in real life and\u00a0(iii) facilitate the serendipitous research of previously\u00a0unnoticed structures.

These data are represented as points on the unit circle or unit sphere, since they have no \"length\". This renders their statistical treatment very delicate, as for instance the simple average of two points on the sphere will result in a point lying inside the sphere and hence not on the sphere. The classical mean thus cannot be used to describe such data, and more generally all statistical procedures must be adapted to these special data types. This has led to the research stream called Directional Statistics. In the present project, I will propose statistical models, in particular probabilistic distributions, to describe and deal with even more complex directional data. I will consider pairs of angular directions, leading to data on the unit torus, pairs of direction and a linear component, leading to data on cylinders, and toroidal/cylindrical data that moreover are spatially correlated, meaning that there is an underlying dependence structure. The new procedures allow me to tackle the data analysis in the following problems: 1) protein structure prediction, where the pairs of dihedral angles form data on the torus, 2) earthquake prediction, where the inter-occurrence time and magnitude form data on the cylinder, and 3) wildfire prediction, where the fire orientation and size are cylindrical data. Spatial dependence is present under 2) and 3).",

To reach that goal, we will aggregate species records, obtained through citizen science (waarnemingen.be), into species groups and define different relevant measures of biodiversity. Species distribution models will be used to reduce the simultaneous effects of several biases that occur in opportunistic citizen science data. A combined approach will be proposed to minimise bias and to jointly include observer profiles (accounting for e.g. the level of expertise of an observer) and landscape metrics (e.g. heterogeneity, configuration) as predictor variables. Our findings will provide insight in the drivers of biodiversity in an agricultural landscape and will allow to simulate the future state of biodiversity by implementing different land use scenarios. To illustrate the application potential of our results, we address the most prominent question in today\u2019 \u2018reen\u2019agricultural policy: do the current policy efforts, meant to safeguard and improve biodiversity, pay off and how can their effectiveness be increased?

Erroneous words and syntax occur frequently in machinetranslated text, leaving the reader to guess parts of the intended message. This project (i) analyzes eye movement data to investigate to what extent the lack of predictability in texts that were created by MT impairs comprehension, and (ii) tries to automatically estimate the comprehensibility of machine-translated text. To tackle the first research objective, we will collect and analyze eye movements of participants reading Dutch machine-translated text. In a first experiment we investigate the impact of different categories of MT errors (syntactic versus semantic, function words versus content words, shortdistance versus long-distance triggers of errors) on comprehension. In a second experiment, the participants read six short machine-translated texts of approximately 300-400 words for comprehension. To tackle the second research objective, an MT comprehensibility estimation system for Dutch will be built. The system takes as input a machine-translated sentence and tries to detect the MT errors that seriously hamper comprehension. We start off with a basic system incorporating baseline features such as sentence length and word frequency and gradually add features derived from language models with increasing complexity, namely n-gram, dependency and neural language models.",

In these studies, literary translators' voices are virtually absent. This project will address the discrepancy between research in Computer Science/AI and Translation Studies, as well as the absence of literary translators from the conversation surrounding technological innovation in their profession. It will do so by proactively integrating literary translators' input in the co-creation of a new technology-inclusive workflow. Professional literary translators will be asked to perform literary translation tasks using (1) MT + post-editing, (2) a Computer-Aided Translation (CAT) tool environment, (3) a CAT tool environment with integrated MT. User testing will be performed using eye tracking, keystroke logging and screen capturing. In-depth interviews and focus groups will be conducted before and after the translation task to register changes in participants' attitudes towards technology before and after using it, as well as advantages and pain points of the tool employed. Being the first study of this kind in literary translation, results will help to (1) devise a technology-inclusive literary translation workflow employing a user-led approach, (2) assess whether and to what extent translation technology can enhance literary translators (particularly, the potential of CAT tools to work in combination with MT and/or as an alternative to MT-centric approaches will be assessed), and (3) mediate a dialogue between literary translators and translation technology developers by feeding back data on literary translators' use of and attitudes towards translation technology to the project's industry partner. It is expected that the project's findings will also contribute to the wider conversation around Human-Computer Interaction in other professions.",

Even though NMT systems are good at simulating rule-like language behaviour and making generalisations, they tend to overgeneralise and they tend to forget infrequent translation patterns while generating translations. Recent work showed that the quality of NMT systems can substantially be improved by integrating explicit translation exemplars into the NMT architecture. These improvements in translation quality brings up new and exciting research questions about the role of exemplars in the field of MT, such as the importance of string-based, semantic and syntactic similarity measures in finding useful exemplars, which can be transferred to the human translation process and language behaviour.\n\nThis research proposal uses techniques from computational linguistics to (i) study the impact of adapting NMT systems through exemplars; (ii) determine the role of different similarity levels, e.g. string-based, semantic and syntactic, in retrieving useful translation exemplars; examine (iii) whether the improvements in translation quality can be observed in different domains, language pairs; and (iv) whether translation exemplars can successfully be used to adapt general-domain NMT systems towards specific domains.",

However, some research showed that post-editing leads to homogenization and normalization. And, although the application of MT to literary translation has been limited, with the increased MT quality due to neural MT, literary translators could also benefit from this technology. Current translation environments allow users to personalise MT systems further by training them on their previously made translations or by adapting to changes a translator makes during translation. Considering that literary translators are under a lot of time pressure (sometimes to the extent that more than one translator has to work on the same text) and that the translator who started the translation is not always the person to complete the work (e.g., illness, death), MT could help by increasing speed and preserving the original translator's style. This research proposal uses techniques from stylometry (i.e., identifying textual features to classify texts) to examine (i) whether a personalised MT system can preserve a translator's style better than a generic MT system, and this (ii) even to the extent that it can be used to ensure uniformity in translation projects with more than one translator, and (iii) whether an adaptive MT system adapts to a translator's style or whether it is the translator adapting to the MT system's output.",

Moreover, it remains to be determined how different ways of MT use affect the L2 writing product across proficiency levels. Further research, taking more measures for variation in MT lookup behavior into account, in combination with L2 proficiency, is needed to fully understand how access to MT during writing affects the L2 writing product. Lastly, the effects of MT use on the L2 writing process are still underresearched, in particular in terms of the cognitive processes underlying L2 learners' online behavior. Further research, in which online and introspective data of more participants are triangulated, is needed to fully understand how MT use affects the L2 writing process.

Consequently, reliable speech enhancement even in the presence of strong reverberation and interference is more important than ever. To cope with these conditions, the problems of source separation and dereverberation are considered jointly. The performance of the system is optimized through the incorporation of data collected by supplementary sensors such as bone conduction microphones, as well as relevant parameters that are estimated in advance. A novel direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimator that uses deep learning to localize sources accurately even for strong reverberation and at a large distance makes it possible to fully exploit the availability of multiple microphones. Using advanced adaptive beamforming techniques, the signal along the target direction can be extracted from the mixture with unwanted components. For ensuring the best possible synergy with the beamformer, the DOA estimation module will be fitted for the specific task of speech enhancement. Examples for further promising parameters are a characterization of the speech and noise properties as well as the acoustic properties of the environment, e.g., in terms of the reverberation time.",

By leveraging the technological know-how available in Flanders, combined with a joint effort to make speech data available for the development of speech technology, tailor-made speech solutions can be provided at reasonable cost, a cost that medium and small companies can bear. Our research results will be validated on other languages as well and should be readily applicable to other (European) countries with similarly diverse language variation and market (e.g. Switzerland, France, Italy, Poland, ...). The project outcomes include (1) open source tools and publications describing the underlying technology, (2) a public repository containing the collected data (speech, annotations, and pseudo-annotations, with a focus on the more challenging speech data such as spontaneous speech, dialects, and speech form non-natives) that can be made publicly available, (3) a private repository containing the data which is only available for research by trusted parties, (4) a web-service to allow citizen and companies to donate additional speech for either the public\nor private repository, (5) models for open source speech recognition toolkits which are made available to (local) industry, and (6) webservices built on top of those models and toolkits to provide easy access to a baseline automatic speech transcription setup.",

For instance, information on functional effects other than differential expression are not accounted for (splice variants, post-translational modifications). Therefore, in this project we aim at 1) developing an innovative framework that allows converting publicly available data in a context-dependent network prior. This method, based on network representation learning, will allow summarizing relevant omics information in respectively a graph and vector based prior representation of the interaction network. 2) Improving NBM to use the probabilistic graph based prior and to accommodate the intricacies of the data.  3) Developing an alternative integrative method that operates directly on the vector rather than graph based representation. Our methods will be tuned in the context of cancer systems genetics and applied on a unique set of tumor data to gain insight into pathways driving the early onset of breast cancer and into the molecular mechanisms driving metastatic prostate cancer.",

However, molecular profiling is complicated in many cancer types by the heterogeneous nature of the carcinogenic process and is restricted because of budgetary reasons. Now, the digitization of histopathology glass slides to Whole Slide Images (WSIs) presents unprecedented opportunities for cost-efficient analyses of tumor properties. Namely, WSIs are available without additional cost as they are obtained in routine clinical practice for diagnostic purposes. Even though they intrinsically offer morphological rather than molecular information, recent studies have shown the potential of deep learning techniques to extract hidden morphological features from WSIs that associate with molecular properties. Hence, deep learning models on WSIs present the potential to gain fundamental insights on the presence of omics properties and their spatial (co)location, and as a result to guide prognosis. Specifically, in this project we will investigate the potential of using WSIs as a cost efficient proxy for spatially resolved molecular profiling of tumor properties. Hereto, we will develop an innovative deep learning framework for the analysis of WSIs which will be generic and efficient to fine-tune on different omics prediction tasks in various cancer types.",

New pesticides have to comply to\u00a0stringent requirements regarding biodegradability.

This is relevant since many new\u00a0pesticide compounds are structural variants of older ones for which the degradation pathways are\u00a0known.

Methods that rely on a prior interaction network have delivered promising results in identifying these drivers. However, current models highly oversimplify biological reality: The networks that drive the analysis do not capture the context of the tumor. Also, because aberrations are modeled at gene level the possibility that distinct mutations in the same gene affect this gene differently across samples cannot be considered. To cope with these problems, we will 1) use a data-driven approach to construct a context-specific probabilistic network and 2) develop a model that allows exploiting the yet unexploited functional information to trace back the effect of each single aberration over this network. To do so, the method assumes that a driver aberration elicits a response that propagates through the network. Key to the method is the use of an aberrant expression phenotype (differential expression level, isoform switches, \u2026) to trace and quantify this propagating response, called the path of influence (POI). Based on characteristics of their POI, each somatic aberration is scored to identify drivers. Cohort-level analysis then allows identifying driver pathways by searching for overrepresented POIs in high-scoring aberrations. Applying the method to the ICGC PAWG data will contribute to a systems level understanding of tumorigenesis.",

Genotypeexpression phenotype data thus intrinsically are perfectly suited to infer molecular interaction networks. Therefore, in this project a scalable methodology will be developed that not only associates genomic variations to corresponding expression changes (classical eQTL analysis), but that also infers the cellular interaction network underlying the association. Our method is original in (1) maximally exploiting the complementary information contained within publicly available interaction networks and (2) analyzing all complementary data sources (genomic variation, expression variation and network information) in an integrated, rather than a sequential way, which allow us to better cope with the problem of underdetermination from which most eQTL analyses suffer. We will benchmark our methods on publicly available yeast and cancer datasets. To show the ability of our method in inferring causal networks from perturbations triggered by genetic variation in natural variants, we willanalyse a dedicated plant dataset.",

Whereas most mutations have a neutral or deleterious effect on the cellular fitness, occasionally adaptive mutations occur. Often adaptive mutations only drive a fitness increase in the presence of other mutations, a phenomenon referred to as epistasis. When epistasis occurs between mutations in different genes, this is referred to as intergenic epistasis. Intergenic epistasis is prevalent during\nadaptive evolution. However, an understanding of how intergenic epistasis contributes to remodeling pathway activities that enable or abrogate the beneficial effect of future mutations is still largely missing. Here we aim at gaining such a pathway-level understanding of intergenic epistasis by combining a dedicated experimental evolution set up with the proper analysis methods.\nKey to the analysis is the development of bioinformatics methods that allow exploiting parallelism between independently evolved clones to identify adaptive pathways and to assess the impact of mutations on rewiring the molecular interaction network. As a proof-of-concept the framework will be applied to study the effect of intergenic epistasis on the mode of evolution of bacterial populations subjected to different antibiotic gradients. This will not only provide novel insights from a fundamental point of view, but will also contribute to the optimization of clinical antibiotic treatment.",

This overall objective will be achieved in five goals, with two goals focused on critical efforts to enable effective internal reanalysis and reuse, and three goals focused on kick-starting widespread external reuse. Internal reuse critically requires two key things right now, tackled in the first two goals: (i) the provision of comprehensive and reliable metadata for publicly available data sets; and (ii) the availability of a variety of very well-annotated and carefully characterised reference data sets to serve as key benchmarking, tutorial, and template materials, amongst others. On the other hand, widespread external reuse across the life sciences will be jump-started by three coordinated and directly complementary efforts, which are captured in the next three goals: (iii) by creating an automated flow of information from proteomics data, over sophisticated reprocessing pipelines, to the UniProt Knowledgebase for protein sequence and context information, and to the Protein Data Bank for protein structural information, thus ensuring that all researchers across the life sciences can easily come across and access this information in the broadest possible context; (iv) by providing a cutting-edge, discovery-driven research showcase for proteomics data reuse, centred on elucidating biological meaning for proteome-wide PTM discovery results; and (v) strongly driven outreach and dissemination efforts that are firmly rooted in open science, and that include standard academic channels, comprehensive and wide-ranging interactions with industry, and even outreach to the general public at a global scale. Taken together, in ODEEP-EU, we can utilise two decades of effort in open science infrastructure establishment in proteomics as the launchpad from which to propel the field into a key role as sheer limitless treasure trove of important novel knowledge and insights for the life sciences at large.",

Often, disease-specific proteins in liquid biopsies are tissue leakage proteins (TLPs), derived from tissues directly affected by the disease and thus early signs of this disease. However, such TLPs tend to occur at low concentrations, requiring sensitive approaches. One of the most sensitive means to detect proteins is mass spectrometry, and the most recent development in this field is data-independent acquisition (DIA) technology. Yet, even though DIA is the most popular protein biomarker discovery technology in clinical practice, there are still opportunities to improve the sensitivity of detection with more advanced bioinformatics and statistics approaches. This is especially important for the reliable detection of low abundance TLPs, which will benefit from a tissue-specific protein expression catalogue. This because it currently is difficult to allocate detected protein markers to their tissue(s) of origin. I will here therefore develop the bioinformatics components needed to enable sensitive DIA for TLPs. I will moreover integrate these components into a complete workflow, which I will then validate on both public data, as well as on relevant in-house data from clinical samples in neurodegenerative disease and cancer contexts.",

However, to achieve this, three challenges must be addressed: detecting low-abundance proteins, identifying their tissue of origin, and understanding functional perturbations. This will be achieved through four work packages: (i) develop performant machine learning models and optimising their features for data from the highly performant diaPASEF mode of the timsTOF instrument; (ii) use these features to create a sensitive and specific search engine for data analysis; (iii) tracing proteins back to their tissue of origin using tissue prediction models and perform functional protein association mining to create functional networks of proteins to elucidate functional perturbations; and (iv) combining the analytical advances with the biological context to obtain candidate biomarkers for DM1.

One of the most abundant and most studied PTMs is phosphorylation, which plays a key role in signal transduction, and is disrupted in diseases as varied as Alzheimer\u2019s and cancer. Because of this large interest and broad application domain, my research will focus on improving the detection of phosphorylation. My objective is to create a novel method for the identification of phosphorylated proteins, based on the re-use of the large amounts of data in public proteomics databases. Indeed, these data can be used to train machine learning algorithms that can improve the identification of phosphorylated proteins. This can occur because existing data can teach the machine learning algorithms to predict an accurate, theoretical spectral library for all possible phosphorylated peptides, complete with detailed peak intensity information. This should lead to an unbiased search engine with a much higher sensitivity than existing methods. Moreover, this data-driven approach can easily be adapted to all current, and possible future fragmentation techniques.",

While chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) allows for a high-throughput investigation of PTMs, bioinformatics tools to analyze the resulting data are lacking. Indeed, due to the large variability in potential PTMs or artefactual modifications, proteomics search engines suffer from a decreased identification sensitivity when including modifications into the search space. Deep learning models that accurately predict peptide LC-MS/MS behavior have shown to recover the identification sensitivity, although such predictors are limited to unmodified peptides. Very recent work by me and my colleagues on peptide retention time prediction has shown that deep learning models can generalize predictions across modified and unmodified residues. I therefore here propose to extend these methods to the prediction of peptide MS/MS spectra, enabling these spectra to be predicted for any peptide modification. Furthermore, by integrating the two prediction tasks and investigating more advanced deep learning techniques, I aim to push prediction accuracy to the limit of technical variance. I will also leverage these novel predictors for much increased identification sensitivity, and for improved localization of PTMs. Finally, I will apply these novel tools on a large amount of public proteomics data to generate the most detailed view ever of the proteome-wide PTM landscape.",

My project therefore focuses on providing an advanced and generalised proteome-based tissue prediction model as the fundamental proteome landscape mapper. By integrating sequential, structural and PTM data, its application potential will be expanded to different model organisms, differential analysis in disease, and low-input samples (single-cell and organoid data). Simultaneously, I will also actively invest in promoting metadata annotation for new data sets using my established lesSDRF tool, and by fostering community efforts. Moreover, I will develop automated tools for retroactive metadata annotation of existing public domain datasets, thus optimising metadata availability for all public proteomics data sets.

However, with kinase-substrate associations important pharmacological targets, better context-aware information on protein phosphorylation and kinase-substrate association is essential to define their role in cellular communication and disease. In this project, we aim to identify and extend kinase-substrate association based on different biological and pathological context by re-processing and re-using available public mass-spectrometry based proteomics data, which we will integrate with functional and physical protein association networks, tissue and sub-cellular annotations, and various sequence, structural and biophysical features.

A major problem in developing vaccines for diseases such as cancer and those caused by intracellular bacteria is that these must rely heavily on T-cell immunity, which requires the identification of efficiently presented MHC-epitopes that will elicit a potent immune response in the body. The identification of such MHC-bound epitopes is pursued most directly through immunopeptidomics, in which the bound epitopes are isolated and analyzed. However, while new mass spectrometry-based protocols are being designed to increase the sensitivity of the experimental identification of these epitopes, including in the lab of my co-promotor Prof. Impens, bioinformatics tools that can efficiently identify the resulting fragmentation mass spectra lag behind. I here therefore will develop novel bioinformatics tools that are specifically tailored to work with such immunopeptidomics data.

                "project_Description": "This application is a renewal of the Scientific Research Network (2015-W001015N) with the same title that runs from 2015 until end of 2019. This renewal updates two Flemish members of the consortium and adds an additional partner from the French speaking region. During the five years of the previous Research Network, important scientific contributions were already made by the consortium, as is evidenced from the many jointly organised events, jointly submitted grant proposals, and jointly authored publications (see the final report for details). And with the addition in this renewal application of three new, highly qualified and uniquely complementary research groups to the consortium, the scope and expertise of the Research Network expands even further. At the same time, because of changes in location and research focus, two groups are no longer part of this renewal proposal. The KULeuven unit of Prof. Jan Ramon (department head: Prof. Maurice Bruynooghe) is no longer part as Prof. Ramon has taken up a new position at INRIA in Lille, France, and has changed his research topic. The UGent group of Steven Maere is also no longer part of this renewal, as this group has also changed their research focus over the past years. In their place, three new groups are included. Two of these groups are included because of their strong focus on cutting edge statistical methods for omics data, which was identified as a missing element in the previous consortium. These two groups are the statOmics group of Prof. Lieven Clement at UGent, and the recently founded CBIO group of Prof. Laurent Gatto at the De Duve Institute at UCLouvain. The third new group in this application, the group of Prof. Giovanni Samaey at KULeuven, focuses on efficient yet performant numerical algorithms which have also been identified within the consortium as a bottleneck going forward, especially given the ever rising sizes of data sets, and the ever increasing complexity of the algorithms developed within the consortium to extract new knowledge from these data. Indeed, continuing from the previous Research Network, this consortium remains focused on optimally extracting value from the deluge of publicly available omics data that is produced by today\u2019s high-throughput analytics in molecular biology. Each analysis characterises and quantifies thousands to hundreds of thousands of genes, transcripts, or proteins, and only small fractions of these vast amounts of information are actually needed for, and used in, the research context in which these data are being collected. However, because these data are steadily archived in ever-growing public data repositories, there is a tremendous amount of promise in re-analysing these data using sophisticated, special-purpose algorithms that can handle the massive data set sizes as well as their substantial heterogeneity. This is precisely where the combined expertise of the groups in this consortium comes in, as together they constitute an internationally acclaimed and already established network of leading scientists that are transforming the way that life scientists are looking at their own, and at others\u2019, data. The main scientific objective of this Scientific Research Community is therefore to perform large-scale mining and analysis of public life sciences data in different domains, and then to integrate these findings into multiscale knowledgebases to provide context and uncover functional relevance. The final outcomes will thus not only be jointly organized events, joint national and international grant applications, and joint papers, but also reliable, easy-to-use online knowledgebases (similar to the LNCipedia, online Tabloid Proteome, and Scop3P resources that have been jointly developed in the previous Research Network) that can be accessed freely by any interested researcher in the life sciences. The research groups assembled here in this Research Network application are uniquely placed to perform this leading work, and can build on strong shared interests coupled with highly complementary skill sets (see group descriptions below). The planned work to be jointly undertaken (presented in more detail in the tabular from in the section on concrete planning below) is at the same time highly ambitious and necessarily highly interdisciplinary. And the only way in which the goals set out in this project can thus be achieved, is to have several expert groups interact closely and constructively. In the process, this Research Network will provide enormous benefit to the Flemish members, by firmly establishing these groups as absolute world leaders in the field of public omics data reprocessing, and will hence also benefit the Flemish research community by making Flanders the most attractive region in the world for ambitious and talented PhD students and postdocs to work in.",

Yet proteins are often subject to naturally occurring modifications of their basic structure, which happen after the protein has been synthetized in the cell. These modifications are termed post-translational modifications (PTMs) and can have substantial effects on protein function and activity. Therefore, these PTMs are highly relevant to our understanding of the cell in health and disease. Several bioinformatics tools (including our in-house software tool ionbot) have already been developed to detect these PTMs on the proteome, the entire set of proteins that can be expressed by cells at a certain moment. However, as there are currently no reliable methods to quantify the differential occurrence of PTM-carrying proteins across samples, this information cannot yet be fully exploited. I here therefore propose to create the statistical means to obtain a proteome-wide quantitative view of PTMs. These novel statistical means can, after fine-tuning, be implemented in the existing ionbot tool. This will add considerable commercial value to this powerful tool, as it will extend its existing PTM identification capabilities with novel and powerful PTM quantification capabilities. This is particularly relevant in light of current plans in the group to create an ionbot-centered start-up company.",

The OPTIMISTIC clinical trial has shown that Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), a patienttailored intervention to increase activity and enable patients to deal with their disease, imparts strong benefit on patients\u2019activity and participation (Lancet Neurology, 2018). We now propose a multi-omic approach to identify the molecular signatures of the response to this clinical intervention, taking advantage of the thorough clinical characterization of the enrolled patients and the comprehensive set of serum samples at baseline and two followup time points. Our lead hypothesis is that pathways associated with the positive response to CBT can be consolidated or reinforced by conventional drug therapies targeting the same pathways. A network-based bioinformatics approach shall be used to identify drug targets in the molecular signatures. We shall repurpose clinically approved drugs for these targets and measure their impact on molecular profiles of patients\u2019induced pluripotent stem cells, differentiated to multiple DM1-relevant cell types (cortical neurons, motorneurons and myofibers). The effect of the most promising drug candidates will be evaluated in the DMSXL and HSA-LR mouse models, employing cognitive, behavioural and motor readouts that are reminiscent of the clinical readouts in the OPTIMISTIC trial. The systemic and muscle-restricted expression of the transgene in two different mouse models allows for exploration of the brain/muscle axis in the cognitive and behavioural aspects of the disease. Repurposed drugs can be evaluated in isolation or combination with other interventions like CBT in future clinical trials for DM1 and other neurological conditions. The drug repurposing strategy based on the reverse engineering of a positive response to a behavioural intervention may set the scene for future drug development trajectories for rare diseases.",

Despite its rapid rise, this field still suffers from low identification rates compared to single species proteomics because of two main reasons: (1) the dense fragmentation spectra caused by co-fragmentation, and (2) the profound lack of sequence resolution in traditional search engines. In this postdoc, I will seek methodological solutions to tackle these two issues, and therefore increase the identification rate in metaproteomics. The first solution can be found in analyzing co-fragmented spectra from both DDA as well as DIA datasets. The second solution will be to further extend our state-of-the-art tool MS2Rescore, where I will combine multiple search engines, including the co-fragmentation search engines from the first solution, and will add a new predictor for ion mobility.

Several different types of such protein associations are known, including direct protein-protein interaction, protein complex formation, and (coordinated) participation in the same metabolic or signaling pathway. However, current protein association studies tend to be biased towards the detection of binary protein-protein interactions. As a result, all types of protein association tend to be poorly analyzed. This is an important gap in our knowledge, as these other association types also play a crucial role in biology, and their absence thus hampers our understanding of many biological processes.

                "project_Description": "Metaproteomics is the study of the proteins expressed by all organisms in complex environments or ecosystems such as the human gut or a water treatment plant. Based on protein fragments (peptides) found in the environment, we can infer which proteins these peptides originated from, which organisms created them, and which biological functions they perform. These analyses are done with specialised software tools such as Unipept. Unipept is developed by the Computational Biology Lab at Ghent University to derive the taxonomic and functional signature of samples from an analysis of metaproteomics data. Unipept is widely used in the field because of its performance, user-friendliness and interactive data visualisations. \n\nRecently, the field of metaproteomics has been moving towards bigger, high-throughput experiments. Unipept, as a web-based tool, is not an ideal fit to handle this data deluge. Its set of command line tools, on the other hand, are specifically created for high-throughput experiments, but they lack the user-friendliness and interactive visualisations of the web application. This research proposal aims to solve these shortcomings by creating a Unipept desktop application. This tool will allow researchers to manage, analyse, and compare huge datasets while maintaining complete control over their data. In addition, it will create the opportunity to use custom databases tailored to specific experiments.",

The high-throughput method to study the protein content of a cell is using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and is acquired in a data dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. This DDA approach is limited to the identification and quantification of a small subset of generally selecting the most abundant peptides. Data independent acquisition (DIA) allows for a more comprehensive view of the proteome because it does not put selection criteria on peptides and measures a wider variety of peptides at the same time. However, this makes the data analysis substantially more complex as it needs to be deconvolved. In this project proposal, I will describe a new, library-free DIA search engine that can nevertheless tackle the identification ambiguity problem. I will achieve this reduction of identification ambiguity by predicting even more aspects of peptide behavior than existing tools. In addition to leveraging these new predictive models, I will also optimize the scoring features extracted from these predictions. Moreover, the resulting identification ambiguity reduction should even allow for a more open modification search in DIA data, promising substantial impact on downstream biological analysis.",

We are now in a unique position to not only push forward technically but also business-wise as the results of our work and the prototype demonstrator were welcomed with enthusiasm from relevant key players. We are now in intensive discussions with important key players in the market of industrial communications to investigate the possibility of a future collaboration.\nDuring our in-depth discussion with possible end-users and integrators two major issues were identified that need to be addressed before they are ready to adopt our MVP. The first was the need to further test the current solution and minimize the impact of random external interference on our system\u2019s offered QoS at all times. A clear threshold based on the maximum possible interference the system can withstand in order to maintain correct operation needs to be clearly defined through testing. This will enable the end-user to know exactly under which conditions our system can provide the advertised QoS performance. Furthermore, it was identified that the system\u2019s control channel, although robust by design based on the physical layer coding used, is not protected enough against external interference. Hence, a dynamic control channel allocation scheme needs to be designed and integrated in the system that will make the control channel of the BtW system really robust against any kind of interference.\nBusiness-wise, we aim to continue discussions and complete negotiations with integrators in the field of industrial communications systems so we can define the way to move forward for valorization. The successful finalization of these negotiations is essential to gain credibility before reaching out to Venture Capitalists and other types of investors for external funding that will enable our project to be transformed into a start-up and implement our business plan.",

To optimize theseheterogeneous networks, ad hoc cooperation between co-located devices of different networktechnologies is needed.To this end, this project develops methodologies for cross-network, cross-technologynegotiation. To optimize the network performance of co-located networks in a global way, colocated devices take into account the network requirements of all devices when negotiating about cooperation opportunities (in the form of sharing network resources). As part of this project, the following challenges are tackled. (i) A network service architecture is developed, in which network functionality (such as interference avoidance, dynamic transmission powercontrol, shared routing, different routing protocols, etc.) can be added to devices at run-time.(ii) Distributed network monitoring algorithms are developed. These algorithms are capableof detecting co-located (heterogeneous) networks and can monitor how the activation ofnetwork services influences the performance of multiple co-located networks that usedifferent communication technologies. (iii) Finally, negotiation algorithms based onreinforcement learning are developed to select the optimal network services that should beactivated, based on the network requirements of the collaborating devices.Ultimately, this project leads to autonomous algorithms capable of negotiating about optimal network optimization solutions that take into account the heterogeneity and dynamicrequirements of co-located devices.",

On top, IDLab is open to research and development collaborations to customize the IP on partners\u2019 request. This dual strategy allows us to focus on bilateral collaborations with partners and in parallel further develop openwifi in various research projects in area of deterministic networking in partnership with other research groups. As the use of standards is important for companies and research partners when adopting or using new technologies, openwifi compliance with WiFi standards is key to convince industry and to strengthen our offering.

While today reliable connectivity can only be achieved by wires, future critical applications demand wireless connectivity. To this end, a radically different radio architecture is needed, offered by cellfree massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO). With CF-mMIMO, radio access is evolving from a cell-centric to a user-centric architecture. It is enabled by a massive number of distributed, interconnected access points (APs) that are coherently beaming radio signals to harden the radio channel and limit interference. This architecture is considered as the most promising 6G innovation, however, many fundamental cross-disciplinary research challenges need to be tackled to narrow the gap between the promise of the current theoretical concept and scalable and costeffective solutions with manageable complexity. In this project, 3 research teams from UGent and imec with complementary expertise and a strong theoretical, experimental and analog/digital technology background, aim to address key fundamental research challenges hindering the deployment of realistic CF-mMIMO solutions: - Optimized fronthaul (FH) electronics for a serial multi-hop architecture - Advanced low-MAC and PHY signal processing on constrained FH networks - Multi-AP synchronization and self-calibration scheme - Flexible open-design, end-to-end integration and validation in realistic scenarios To strengthen the research activities, the project will offer a complete evaluation platform for follow-up research purposes, consisting of a set of hardware components (distributed nodes and centralized processing unit), pre-installed software/firmware (with full communication stack), documentation, visualization tools and support. This evaluation platform will enable exploration of early CF-mMIMO solutions for validating professional applications in real-life environments.",

The system operates in a signal enhancement and noise reduction context, where for each participant the desired signals from different remote locations have to be enhanced while undesired signals have to be suppressed. This requires noise reduction techniques where multiple microphone signals obtained from different nodes are optimally combined to generate an enhanced signal.Since the nodes will not have a fixed location they effectively form a dynamic large-\u00ad\u2010scale ad hoc wireless sensor network (WSN) between acoustic sensors (microphones). Due to the limited communication resources, the noise reduction algorithm should intelligently select the necessary microphone signals that should be transmitted over the network. To this end, this project targets an unseen and particularly challenging cross-\u00ad\u2010layer optimization, with network layer resource negotiation based on application layer utility functions. Addressing these issues will lead to fundamental contributions and frontier WSN innovation, and hence significant progress in the broader field of audio signal processingand network design.",

Nearly all systems use some form of digital\u00a0image restoration or reconstruction algorithm (DRA) to either improve image quality or as an\u00a0essential part of their operation. The large impact of DRAs has enabled new applications, such as\u00a0light field cameras, heterogeneous sensor devices, microwave tomography or HDR and 3D\u00a0television. It is evidenced by the recent Nobel Prize for (the resolving power of) STED fluorescence\u00a0microscopy. As DRA applications grow in number and become more diverse and complex, so does\u00a0DRA design. This is exacerbated by the fact that developing better-quality DRAs often means\u00a0tailoring to specific application use cases (which are generally not even known in full detail yet). To\u00a0solve these limitations to digital imaging, we propose a new methodology for the design of DRAs.\u00a0The main idea of this methodology is to allow a human to directly input application-specific\u00a0information in a general DRA. A human can provide the DRA with very accurate models about\u00a0noise, the acquisition system and the type of image that is expected for a very specific use case\u00a0because the human can base those pieces of information on his expertise and current user\u00a0demands. By comparison, existing DRAs are often based on powerful, yet less specific models by\u00a0necessity because a DRA designer cannot accomodate all possible use case details.",

Vergelijkbare multi-sensor perceptiesystemen zijn ge\u00efntegreerd in drones, schepen en autonoom geleide voertuigen in fabrieken.\nRealtime weggebruikersdetectie en tracking in bestuurdersassistentiesystemen vertrouwen te-genwoordig op geavanceerd deep learning, onafhankelijk uitgevoerd per sensor en ge\u00efntegreerd in een slimme sensor. Dergelijke slimme sensoren produceren geometrische primitieven \u00a0en hoogwaardige objectbeschrijvingen (bijv. objectklasse). Dit late fusieparadigma dwingt individue-le slimme sensoren echter om vroege beslissingen te nemen over welke informatie (niet) naar het fusiecentrum moet worden verzonden en is verre van optimaal. Vroege fusie fuseert in plaats daarvan direct onbewerkte gegevens door gezamenlijk radar-, LiDaR- en cameragegevens te verwerken in een diep neuraal netwerk (DNN). Vroege fusie kan late fusie overtreffen omdat het zwak bewijsmaeriaal kan exploiteren, dat het fusiecentrum niet bereikt in het geval van late fusie. Niettemin is vroege fusie ongeschikt voor autonoom rijden omdat het alle gegevens tege-lijk verwerkt, waardoor het niet schaalbaar is vanwege de snelle toename van de gegevenssnel-heid met extra sensoren. Bovendien mist het flexibiliteit, waardoor volledige hertraining noodza-kelijk is bij het toevoegen, verwijderen of upgraden van sensoren, en het is niet robuust tegen sensorstoringen.Het voorstel stelt in plaats daarvan co\u00f6peratieve sensorverwerking voor fusie in multimodale sensorsystemen voor. Dit innovatieve paradigma verwijst niet naar co\u00f6peratieve multi-agent perceptie, maar in plaats daarvan naar het verbeteren van lokale sensorverwerking in DNN-uitgeruste slimme sensoren met een beperkte hoeveelheid contextinformatie op hoog niveau van andere sensoren of het fusiecentrum. De context omvat (1) kandidaatobjecten die door de andere sensoren zijn gevonden; (2) het vertrouwen dat de andere sensor erin heeft; (3) de de-tectieomstandigheden waarin de andere sensor werkt (bijv. de betrouwbaarheid van de camera is afhankelijk van de lichtomstandigheden); en (4) de context van de sc\u00e8ne.(3) en (4) zijn nieuw en belangrijk: ze stellen \u00e9\u00e9n sensor in staat om te beoordelen in hoeverre de context die de andere sensor biedt, te vertrouwen is. Als een radar bijvoorbeeld met grote ze-kerheid beweert dat er voetgangers aanwezig zijn, maar de camera ze niet ziet, kan de camera vervolgens leren dat sommige voetgangers niet zichtbaar zijn op specifieke locaties in de sc\u00e8ne (bijvoorbeeld achter de hoek van een gebouw). In plaats van met grote zekerheid uit te voeren dat er geen weggebruiker aanwezig is, voert de camera vervolgens uit dat hij niet kan beslissen, waardoor de context van de sc\u00e8ne wordt geleerd. In een ander voorbeeld heeft Dopplerradar moeite om een lege sc\u00e8ne te onderscheiden van een onbeweeglijke voetganger. Wanneer een camera een persoon detecteert, kan hij de radar eenvoudig aanvullende context bieden over de vraag of de voetganger in beweging is. Deze context is zeer waardevol voor radar, omdat deze nieuwe functies kan leren om dergelijke situaties effectiever aan te pakken.",

In this project, the\u00a0term \u201cfusion\u201d is used as the general term for combining information from more than one image\u00a0source.\u00a0One difficulty is that images of similar land cover display dissimilar radiometric properties due to the\u00a0changes in illumination, atmospheric or other observational conditions between acquisitions. This\u00a0causes so-called spectral variability, i.e. variation in spectral appearance of a specific material within\u00a0and between images. Another problem is that most hyperspectral sensors have wavelength\u00a0dependent characteristics.\u00a0Our overall objective is to develop data fusion techniques that account for these spectral aspects\u00a0and in this way enhance the spectral properties of a fused image or a derived product such as a land\u00a0cover classification map.\u00a0Specific objectives are to develop techniques for removing wavelength depending blur and noise\u00a0and for adapting images and classifiers to changing observational circumstances.

Autonomous bus shuttles can be a game changer for cities to address many of these challenges. However, current solutions lack a coordinated regulatory safety framework among European cities. Low public trust and acceptance of new technology along with significant investments, organising insurance and maintaining driver safety, are still notable barriers for cities.  LivingLAPT will also deliver autonomous shuttle logistics services in the City of Ricany nearby Prague in the Czech Republic, Hasselt in Belgium, Kongsberg in Norway, and Helmond in The Netherlands, by phasing out the need for drivers in shuttles and moving toward remote operators. A robust transnational safety framework will be developed and user acceptance and trust developed with citizens, cities, operators, academia, industry, and policymakers.",

                "project_Description": "The main novelty of the proposed research relates to the principle of distributed video restoration itself: we explicitly take into account the cost of communication and joint processing and define the multi-camera restoration problem as a set of loosely coupled single-camera restoration problems while still aiming to achieve optimal performance. Although Distributed Video Coding (DVC) adopts a similar philosophy. Our goals are: to develop a mathematical framework for restoration of video sequences using side information, to determine which type of side information is most appropriate, and to develop strategies for exchanging this side information. To truly demonstrate the power of the theory we will focus on a more challenging use case: that of restoring the depth sequences as captured by ToF or narrow base line stereo cameras (for which high-quality depth maps are hard to acquire with a single camera).\n\n\n\nWe will assume that the side information consists of two different types: rough and detailed. The rough side information is a rough estimate of objects in the scene along with their geometry. IPI has worked on this problem before and we know that this information can be computed without video communication using camera networks. The detailed side information is sent by other cameras upon request, with the restriction that the overall bandwidth for this side information is limited, for scalability reasons.\n\n\n\nThe first sub-objective is to define measures for judging the quality of local depth estimates as a function of time and spatial coordinates: only local estimates of insufficient quality merit the use of limited resources to improve them, and only high quality estimates merit the resources used to transmit them to other cameras. The existing IPI methods for super-resolution and denoising of video sequences already contain hidden variables indicative of the quality, and these will be used as a starting point.\n\n\n\nA second sub-objective is to define a strategy for deciding which side information to share and in what form. We will assume that a fixed (small) bandwidth is available for transmitting side information and we will also assume a question and answer scenario: camera A first informs camera B about spatio-temporal regions in which side information is needed. Camera B then transmits this information; finally camera A uses it to improve its initial estimate of the depth map. In the initial stages of the research, the side information question-and-answer protocol will be based on heuristics. For instance, we know that estimates by a narrow baseline setup are accurate for objects close to the camera, but of poor quality for distant objects. In later stages of the research the question-and-answer strategy will be formulated in an information theoretical framework: this amounts to assessing the additional information content provided by each piece of possible side information on a training set and then relating this to local context in both the sender and the receiver. This information is subsequently used to define the optimal question and answer strategy. This problem is similar to, but more difficult than, the problem of task assignment in camera networks [13].\n\n\n\nThe third sub-objective is to create new algorithms for joint denoising and super-resolution of depth and video sequences taking into account the side information. The current IPI techniques for denoising and super-resolution are built on probabilistic models (Bayesian estimation framework). The side information needs to be incorporated in these models as an additional input, with the added difficulty that the side information is only available for some spatio-temporal regions of the sequence.",

The associated technologies also signify the solution to the problem of providing genuinely immersive \u201classes-free\u201d3D media, offering not only stereopsis, but also motion parallax. Capturing high-quality multiview content from real-world scenes is an enormous challenge, requiring a huge number of views from finely spaced angles. Unavoidably, the number of captured views is much lower than what required thus, the missing views need to be estimated. However, such view synthesis needs to account for the distances between objects and cameras, complex 3D structure, illumination changes and non-Lambertian reflectance, none of which are captured directly by single cameras. Existing solutions based on stereo or sparse multiview camera setups fail to deliver acceptable 3D video quality. To solve this problem, we propose a fundamental paradigm shift, focusing on multiview multimodal camera systems that combine depth sensors and colour cameras of various spatial resolutions. Multimodal systems are more versatile than linear camera arrays, thereby posing significant research challenges. The goal of the project is to substantially advance over the state-of-the-art on multiview depth estimation and view synthesis by designing radically new algorithms inspired by the new theoretical framework of compressed sensing with side information.",

As such, it is an invaluable tool in present-day material research, product development and quality assessment. \n However, the conversion of uCT data to analytical or finite element models that allow for the simulation of dynamic processes is currently limited by two major constraints: the limited spatial resolution that can be achieved, related to the sample size, and the limited capabilities of providing information about dynamic processes that occur inside objects. \n In this project, we will develop X-ray imaging tools that will improve the state-of-the-art capabilities for model extraction: \n - Grating-based X-ray dark-field imaging using a novel dual-phase grating setup will provide information about features below the resolution attainable with conventional attenuation-based imaging. \n - An intensive coupling between digital volume correlation and tomographic reconstruction of dynamic microCT (4D-microuCT) will increase the spatio-temporal resolution of 4D-microuCT, allowing to maximally exploit all available data \n We will use these tools to derive and verify structural and dynamic models for three different classes of materials: mineral building materials, composite materials and woodbased panels. Furthermore, these models will be used to improve the accuracy and reliability of the uCT reconstruction. \n With these new developments in extraction and experimental validation of material models, materials scientists within and beyond the three aforementioned material classes will be able to develop better and more sustainable materials.",

A proliferation of devices such as RGB-D cameras and LiDAR leads to huge amounts of 3D data that is being captured and analysed by various machine vision systems. Since storing and processing 3D data points in their raw form quickly becomes a bottleneck of a processing system, designing compact, i.e., sparse representations to enable efficient storage and analysis on the fly, is a major challenge. Applying emerging deep learning models on point cloud data directly is not possible because they are not structured and not ordered. Especially challenging is processing of sequences of point clouds, also called dynamic point clouds. While many recognition tasks benefit from using temporal sequences of the monitored scene, processing of dynamic point clouds is very difficult because they are not represented on a regular spatio-temporal grid. Another crucial problem is how to analyse raw point clouds without having to rely on many annotated examples. There is a high demand for such generative models for point clouds. The SPYDER project aims to solve these challenges by developing a generic framework for generative and scalable models for static and dynamic point clouds.",

It is becoming more and more common to acquire the information about the same phenomenon with a multitude of different sensors. For example, in medical diagnostics various imaging modalities are often combined (e.g., X-ray CT and magnetic resonance images) as well as totally different types of data (like one-dimensional electrocardiograms and four-dimensional sequences of volumetric ultrasound data). In remote sensing it is common to combine information from hyperspectral images, comprising several hundreds of bands, with optical and radar images of much higher spatial resolution, and in digital painting analysis optical images are commonly accompanied by radiographs, infrared and multispectral data. In all these and similar cases, the available heterogeneous data contain correlated versions of the same physical world, although each adding some unique piece of information. Extracting the relevant information from this wealth of data becomes a major challenge, which is also addressed in this project. We aim at developing new data representations and inference techniques for the processing of heterogeneous image data.

The applications of these deep learning techniques are many and an increasing number of important technologies depends on them. Despite this, however, virtually all deep learning models have been found to be highly sensitive to so-called adversarial perturbations. These are small, imperceptible perturbations of the natural inputs to these models which cause them to produce arbitrary output. Using black-box adversarial attacks, it is very easy for a malicious actor to generate plausible inputs for a model (that would raise no red flags with any human observers) but that cause the model to behave in an attacker-specified manner, even if the attacker has no knowledge at all about the internals of the model in question. This poses serious security problems that may even lead to loss of life, e.g. when a self-driving car is fooled into thinking a stop sign is actually a speed limit sign. Much research has already gone into devising protective measures against these attacks, but none has had lasting effectiveness. For each new defense that is proposed, some new attack eventually bypasses it. We are in need of robustness guarantees that provably protect our models against specific classes of adversarial attacks, which is what I hope to achieve in this work.",

We will reconstitute or deplete specific stromal-tumor cell interaction(s) or perturb their molecular communications and assess the impact of these perturbations on the GRN controlling TS identity.

One way to gain insight in the status of the patient\u2019s immune system is by using a technique called \u201cflow cytometry\u201d. Given a patient sample (e.g. a blood sample), this technique measures a certain set of surface proteins on all of the individual cells, resulting in a detailed overview of which cell types are present and in which ratios. In the last decade, the number of proteins measured simultaneously has increased from about six to more than thirty. While this detailed information is extremely valuable, the amount of data collected also becomes harder to handle. Computational tools can help, but the current solutions are still insufficient to tackle all challenges, such as detecting very small proportions of clinically relevant cell populations between all other cells. My goal with this project is to improve these computational methods, taking into account the specific setting of primary immunodeficiencies. Overall, these algorithms will allow immunologists to better exploit the high-dimensional cytometry data, enabling them to study the immune system in a more systematic and unbiased way.",

At this point, no spatially aware transcriptome-wide method has reached single-cell level yet, complicating the data analysis. The first step in this project will be to overcome this hurdle. Different types of single-cell omics data can shed a complimentary light on a tissue, but current methods can't go beyond the integration of two data modalities. Variational autoencoder based methods, creating joint latent spaces, seem suitable for this problem, but their black-box nature is a limitation.

The framework will be flexible and easily adapted to new technological developments in the spatial transcriptomics field.

We will also explore and develop new Deep Learning approaches to address the problem at hand. The developed methods will be applied on the wide variety of single-cell datasets that are and will be generated by the host institution and other collaborating research facilities. We expect this close contact to lead to novel results from the biological point of view, which in turn can open new insights on cellular and disease mechanisms.",

Both during development and homeostasis, it is clear that cells require some cues from other cells in their environment for their normal functioning. Cellular differentiation is one of the processes that are heavily influenced by extracellular factors: the micro-environment of a cell can provide unique instructions that sway a cell towards a particular differentiation path. The goal of this project is to computationally model the cell-cell communication networks and their intracellular effects, during a differentiation process. While unbiased methods have already been developed to predict the intracellular networks underlying cellular differentiation, predicting regulatory networks between interacting cells has remained largely unexplored. In this project, I will develop a computational method that uses transcriptomics data to predict what external signals are send between two cells, and how they impact the cellular differentiation. The method will be applied on a model system of liver macrophage differentiation, for which bulk transcriptomics data is currently available (in-house) and single-cell transcriptomics data will be generated by other scientists of the collaborating research group of Prof. Martin Guilliams. Predictions made by the model will in turn be validated in this research group and will lead to a better fundamental understanding of macrophage differentiation.",

Neuroblastoma (NB), is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous childhood cancer which is presumed to arise from sympatho-adrenergic progenitors (SAPs).

Current multimodal intensive therapy is only successful in 50% of cases with survivors suffering from severe long-term side effects thus illustrating the urgent need for a better understanding of the biology of NB. Lineage survival-dependency transcription factors (TF's) and core regulatory circuits (CRC) carefully control cell fate decisions and cell identity. The role of the individual transcription factors including SOX11, implicated in this process, is largely unknown. In this project, I propose to apply a recently established human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived differentiation model towards human sympathoblasts to gain a more in depth understanding of the normal and transformed development of these sympathetic neuronal progenitor cells.

However, while these studies infer cellular functions, they do not allow these to be validated. For this, one must be able to identify, and purify the cells for downstream imaging and/or functional analyses utilizing multi-parameter panels of antibodies. Here, flow cytometry has long been the gold standard for this. However, this field has also changed substantially in recent years. Conventional flow cytometry and its issues regarding cell autofluorescence and multi-parameter panel compensation is now being replaced by spectral flow cytometry. This overcomes these issues using spectral unmixing whereby the entire emission spectrum of each fluorescence molecule & the unstained cells is measured and accounted for. Moreover, the recently launched combination of spectral flow cytometry and high-speed cell imaging means that researchers can now combine many of these analyses in one step on one machine. Such technology, which can also be applied to, for example, the analysis of subcellular components is hence a game changer and thus with FullPicture we aim to bring this to Ghent University.",

One of the strongest environmental risk factors for RA development is cigarette smoking. We hypothesize that cigarette smoking might influence immune regulation and trigger the formation of T cell autoreactivity in the lungs of individuals with a susceptible MHCII background. Our goal is therefore to explore the regional and systemic features of these autoreactive and regulatory immune cells and their link to RA onset.

More study is required to develop tools to diagnose and treat this aspect of CVID.\r\nThe gene IKZF1 encodes for the transcriptional regulator IKAROS and mutations in this gene give rise to CVID.

To study the molecular and phenotypical consequences of IKZF1 mutations, we will combine powerful technologies such as single cell RNA sequencing with a large cohort of patients.

Unfortunately, to fully understand how cellular biology functions, one needs to position the cells in their spatial context. For any cell type, in any species, one needs to know which cells are in the vicinity of the cell of interest. Localising cell types is typically done by antibody-based staining and microscopy. Unfortunately, antibodies are not always available to study specific cell types. Luckily, spatial transcriptomic techniques can now determine the spatial expression of multiple RNA molecules in parallel. As this methodology is based on universal RNA detection, it is applicable across all species: in humans, mammals and plants. The next frontier in single-cell biology is therefore to resolve the precise spatial location of each single cell, so that we can finally understand the tissue architecture for each organ and identify the local cell-cell circuits that control cell fate and functional specialization in health and disease across species.

Because of this failure, elevated lactate and FFAs are no longer converted to glucose and ketone bodies and severe organ damage may occur due to their toxicity. Lise Wyngene found decreasing PPAR\u03b1 levels already starting 6h after sepsis onset. In my project, I am interested in finding the upstream mechanism responsible for this downregulation, with a strong focus on HNF4\u03b1: based on bioinformatics tools, we hypothesize that HNF4\u03b1 (a major driver of PPAR\u03b1 transcription) declines in activity in sepsis. To have more proof of the functional role of HNF4\u03b1 in sepsis, I will study HNF4aAlbcreERT2Tg/+ and HNF4\u03b1-overexpressing mice in the context of survival and use HNF4\u03b1 agonists and antagonists.

We aim to explore if this is due to the lack of knowledge about human trust and acceptance of artificial autonomous delegates that make decisions in their place or even how these delegates should be designed. We study these questions using computational agents models that are validated in a series of behavioural experiments defined around the public goods game. We investigate when and how the autonomous agent may evolve from observer, over decision support to a delegate with full autonomy in decision-making. Using VR and AR technologies, we will investigate if the representation in which the agent is experienced influences trust. All the technology-oriented research is checked against socio-technology acceptance theories through an intricate collaboration with experts in social sciences. The results of this fundamental research will allow us to explore important questions related to the intelligence and interface of the envisioned agents, and lay the foundation for new types of online markets that brings autonomous agents into real-world applications.",

The first part of this PhD will look into how the capabilities and resources of agents (i.e. robots, IoT sensors and IoT actuators) can be modelled and discovered. Agents will need to update the model based on their current state. This will form a critical framework that the rest of the project will build upon. Using the sensing capabilities of different agents the robot will formulate a plan to execute a task. As the plan is executed sections of the plan will be updated based on new sensor input. Combining agents\u2019 actuation capabilities will allow more demanding tasks to be executed, and increase the system\u2019s robustness. Multiple robots will collaborate to complete tasks, while trying to keep costs (e.g. battery and CPU usage, and task execution time) to a minimum. At each milestone experiments will be performed in real-world situations to evaluate how well the algorithms produced cope in uncertain environments. Through these incremental experiments data collection and analysis will be performed to allow conference and A1 journal publications to be produced.",

The needs in geoinformation of the flood managers at the three-time steps mentioned above will be identified through participatory discussions using problem trees. They will be used as compass to ensure relevance between research results and field needs. The expected outcome is that multiple geoinformation needs of flood crisis managers will be met by the products developed in the frame of this project.

In stressful conditions, we often experience a lack of time, whereas on more relaxing occasions we might lose track of time. On the basis of fundamental knowledge from psychology, ChronoPilot will develop a prototype technology to extend or compress human subjective time adaptively, whenever required. Using mixed reality technologies, people will be presented with visual, auditory, and haptic stimulation patterns that directly or indirectly influence their subjective time. We aim at a comprehensive understanding, through modeling of key parameters and the interplay of the different senses in subjective human time perception. Going beyond individual settings, ChronoPilot will also investigate how to coordinate time plasticity in collaborative settings where the actions of one group member affects the perception of the other members. The research will be validated in two scenarios (precision farming and industrial production), where humans alone or humans and robots have to collaborate in realistic and virtual environments. Such scenarios embed the research in our vision of a future man-machine society where robots have become additional stressors in our daily life that alter our time perception. The improved understanding of the psychology of time perception and the complementing technological means to modulate time will have a profound impact on both technology and society. Time will no longer constitute a passive, constant and immutable factor; instead, it will be a novel focal point around which future socio-technical approaches related to human-human and human-machine interaction revolve.",

Chemical recycling via pyrolysis and steam cracking is seen as a promising technology for the recycling of mixed polyolefins into new plastics with identical properties to virgin grades. However, current technologies are not yet efficient from the economic and environmental standpoint. In fact, with only less than 1% of the collected plastic being recycled back to monomers, there is a big demand for more efficient monomer recovery developments. A lot of challenges are related to uncertainties and variations in compositions of waste streams. The current proposal introduces a transformational CIRCA concept of a controlled chemical recycling of polyolefin waste streams. In its core, the concept is based on the predictive modelling approach, where the composition of incoming polyolefinic waste streams is accurately characterized and used to steer the chemical recycling process via built-in structure-property relationships. To monitor complex polyolefin waste streams, the concept adopts an advanced analytical toolset that enables their unambiguous compositional characterization in a fast manner. The obtained data is then used to fine-tune the process parameters for boosting its efficiency. The CIRCA will be implemented at large-scale recycling lines.",

Yet, advanced recycling of tires is still in its infancy and the application of oils produced by classical pyrolysis techniques is impossible without upgrading.

These challenges entail the use of alternative feedstocks compared to the conventional fossil resources, and the design and optimization of chemical processes with a focus on a minimal use of energy and materials next to avoiding pollutant formation. An important methodology to solve these challenges are experimental measurements to search for optimal process parameters such as reactor configurations, reactor conditions and inlet concentrations. These experiments, however, are time consuming, costly and can only cover a limited range of the aforementioned parameters. Modeling of chemical processes can be a great aid to accelerate the understanding of these parameters on the process outcome and minimize the number of necessary experiments. These modeling methodologies rely on a very detailed knowledge of the underlying chemistry to the overall process. This requires the inclusion of all important elementary chemical reactions and their reactants and products. Even more importantly, the reaction rate coefficient of each reaction and the properties of each species are needed, constructing the so called kinetic model. When dealing with common chemical processes, the number of chemical reactions often exceeds a thousand, with hundreds of molecules and intermediates. The amount of data to construct these kinetic models is thus very large. This thesis focusses on the latter, i.e. on how a large number of accurate data can be retrieved automatically without the need for human interaction, which is part of a larger framework of automatic kinetic model generation. For the latter, many parameters, e.g. reaction rate coefficients or thermodynamic properties of molecules, are calculated using approximation methods such as group additivity or other quantitative structure-property relationships. Several of these methods have been proven to yield results of sufficient accuracy, given that they are not used outside their application range. The latter depends on the data used by the approximation model. These data originate from either experimental measurements or from high-level quantum chemical calculations. Today data from these high-level quantum chemical calculations are scarce due to the necessity of user involvement and expertise. Therefore, in this work, methods are developed to allow automatic calculations of a large number of reaction rate coefficients and thermodynamic parameters using ab initio calculations. The results can then be used to develop new approximation schemes, to improve existing one or to extend their applicability range. State of the art Automatically performing ab initio calculations has already been implemented in several computer codes, with a different application in mind than the current work. These methods prove to be of great value and were used to investigate the state of the art. One of these computer codes is \u201cKinBot\u201d, developed at Sandia National Laboratories, which automatically searches for reactions on a potential energy surface. KinBot has been used to identify reactions during npentanol pyrolysis and to calculate accurate rate coefficients for these reactions. They were implemented in a kinetic model which shows good agreement to experimental data. Methodology To automatically perform ab initio calculations, the framework of the kinetic model generator tool \u201cGenesys\u201d is used, providing a computational representation of molecules, intermediates and reactions. The representation entails information on the connectivity of atoms within a species or transition state, in the form of a mathematical graph or connectivity matrix. This information is insufficient to start ab initio calculations, for which three dimensional coordinates of all the atoms are needed. Using \u201cdistance geometry\u201d and force field calculations, the connectivity of a species is translated to three dimensional coordinates. Although these methods have already been applied to molecules and radicals, in this work the application range has been extended to transition states. In several steps, the coordinates are optimized and the lowest energy conformer can be selected. For the latter, high-level ab initio calculations are done, e.g. using the CBS-QB3 level of theory. From the CBS-QB3 calculations, species properties are calculated using statistical thermodynamics, for which the partition functions are calculated using the molecular frequencies. Internal modes resembling rotations around a chemical bond are treated as one dimensional hindered rotors, and the frequencies corresponding to these rotations need to be removed from the partition function calculations. This is automatically done by verifying if the normal mode of a frequency resembles an internal rotation. From the thermodynamic properties calculated for reactants, products and the transition state of a reaction, kinetic parameters can be easily calculated. These parameters are further improved by calculating tunneling corrections. Thermodynamics and kinetics The newly developed methodology has been tested by calculating the thermodynamic properties and rate coefficients of several species and reactions respectively, exhibiting a wide variety of functional groups and molecular structures. These values have been compared to literature data, both experimental as well as theoretic, and an excellent agreement is found, similar to the accuracy of the CBS-QB3 calculations themselves. Automatically performing the calculations has thus no impact on accuracy compared to the \u201cmanual\u201d calculations, and can be done much faster and on a larger scale. Group additivity Using the newly developed methods to automatically perform ab initio calculations, reaction rate coefficients have been calculated for a large set of intramolecular hydrogen abstraction reactions in hydrocarbons, including abstractions by a carbon radical from a neighboring carbon atom up to abstractions by a carbon radical to another carbon atom with a carbon chain of five atoms in between. The influence of the ligands of the attacking and attacked carbon atom has been studied, as well as the influence of substituents on the carbon chain between both reactive atoms. This has led to a new group additivity model for intramolecular hydrogen abstractions, which is able to reproduce the ab initio calculations with sufficient accuracy. Heptane pyrolysis With the new group additivity model for intramolecular hydrogen abstractions, a kinetic model for the pyrolysis of n-heptane has been automatically constructed using \u201cGenesys\u201d. By accounting for the chemistry of small molecules and for the formation of aromatics through literature data, the new model was able to reproduce two datasets in a very wide range of pressures (400 \u2013 1 105 Pa) and temperatures (800 \u2013 1800 K) without any adjustments to the kinetic model using the experiment data itself. A rate of production analysis has unraveled the major reaction pathways, and has shown the necessity of including intramolecular hydrogen abstraction reactions for the correct prediction of several pyrolysis products.",

However, fully-automated synthesis of new drug candidates does not exist, since human input is required for finding appropriate reaction conditions.

Steam crackers have strict limitations on their maximal concentrations to protect the cracker and product quality. Hence, the contaminants\u2019 concentrations in the pyrolysis oils must be tracked. Waste sorting and pyrolysis processes strongly influence those concentrations, but a detailed model describing their influence and interactions is missing. This project will fill this gap by characterizing several plastic waste feeds, facilitating the upgrading of a waste sorting model. Experimental data on the pyrolysis of identified contaminants and complete waste streams will be gathered in two unique setups fitted with the most advanced characterization techniques. This will allow the development of kinetic models for identified halogen- and heteroatom-containing polymers\u2019 pyrolysis. The models will be combined to describe real-life waste pyrolysis and validated against the experimental data. Finally, combining all models will allow describing the chemical recycling value chain, opening pathways for its optimization, and benefiting involved industries.",

Plastic waste contains a significant amount of contaminants in the form of heteroatomic compounds containing O, N, S, Cl and Br. Steam crackers have strict limits on these contaminant concentrations to ensure a high quality product and protect the internal equipment of the steam cracker. As such the pyrolysis oils need to be treated before being send into the cracker. A new emerging technology is that of supercritical water pyrolysis, this is the thermal decomposition of plastic waste under the presence of supercritical water. This technology shows promise to produce a lighter type of pyrolysis oil and remove a fraction of the contaminants during the process. In this project general research will be done in the decomposition behaviour of plastic waste and its contaminants in supercritical water. To this end the reaction network generator Genesys will be expanded to include reactions with polymers. A machine learning model will be developed to estimate polymer properties. The constructed model shall be validated with experiments and finally the calculation time of the model will be reduced aided by machine learning models. This should give significant insight into plastic waste decomposition under supercritical water opening paths for its industrial application and optimization.",

Closing the industrial carbon cycle will prove crucial in achieving the ambitious climate goals the European Union has set for itself in the Green Deal. Conventional dry reforming of methane has gained much attention recently, as it applies CO2 as a carbon source, and provides the opportunity of utilising biogas with a significant amount of CO2. Super-dry reforming of methane is a strongly intensified CO2 conversion process as it converts, making use of nanomaterials, up to 3 CO2 molecules per molecule of CH4 (compared to 1 in conventional dry reforming) into a pure CO stream that can be directly implemented in the blast furnace of a steel mill. A modelling-based approach to the optimisation of nanomaterials formulation for the super-dry reforming process will be developed. The aim of this approach is to enable performance estimation based on readily measurable material properties and, inversely, estimate the desired set of material properties for reaching optimal process performance. A large array of techniques will be explored for the experimental validation of the DFT calculations performed in the study. A multi-scale reactor model has been developed and will be validated with experiments on a super-dry reforming bench-scale setup, incorporating the calculated thermodynamics and kinetics of the nanomaterials.

Intrinsic kinetics refers to the study of the reaction rates and mechanisms of chemical reaction mechanisms at the molecular level, i.e. independent from phenomena such as heat and mass transport. The focus lies on understanding how reactions occur, including the elementary steps involved and the factors influencing their rates. Such kinetics quantify unequivocally the occurring elementary chemical phenomena and lead to a fundamental understanding of the effect of catalyst properties upon the activity, selectivity and stability, and how this performance can be optimised by means of an appropriate reactor design. Intrinsic kinetics aim to determine the rate coefficients, reaction orders and rate laws that describe the connection between reactant concentrations and the rate of reaction. By investigating the intrinsic kinetics, insight can be gained in the underlying mechanisms of chemical reactions and predictions made about reaction rates that can be expected in other conditions and for various types of reactor. Systematic measurement of chemical kinetics is often overlooked during the development of large-scale reactors and/or catalysts. KICK can fill this blind spot by grouping a series of laboratory setups for the investigation of chemical reactions, both for gas and liquid phase reactions and whether or not with a solid catalyst. Experienced operators with extensive expertise are required and available to operate the setups. Supported by a range of spectroscopic, analytical and temperature-programmed characterization techniques, the results obtained will contribute to the development of reaction mechanisms, the optimization of reaction conditions, the design of more efficient catalysts, and the optimization and design of new reactor technology.",

FCC Is conventionally performed in a circulating rising fluidized bed reactor, however, the usage of down-flow reactors offers several advantages such as less species back-mixing and more narrow residence time distributions. Experimental studies have shown that in both riser and downer reactors, catalyst particles tend to agglomerate forming clusters, predominantly in the near-wall region, leading to considerable heat and mass transfer limitations. Wall modifications such as dimples and other indentations can counter this agglomeration. To bring these reactors to a new level, an Euler-Lagrangian CFD framework in CFDEMcoupling will be constructed in which these different wall modifications are to be assessed. This model will accurately account for the hydrodynamic behavior and FCC chemistry in the first demonstration case. However, a general heterogeneous chemistry framework will be constructed allowing for micro-kinetic models to be implemented directly in the solver. The micro-kinetic model developed at the Laboratory for Chemical Technology (LCT) for catalytic conversion of plastic waste will serve as case study to demonstrate the solver\u2019s flexibility.

                "project_Description": "The conversion of methane to hydrogen and valuable hydrocarbons is becoming increasingly important due to the availability of methane and the increasing demand for these chemicals. However, there are still some challenges around this. When methane is converted to hydrogen, a large fraction of carbon remains where there is little added value, this makes the process uneconomic. Large amounts of energy are required for this and the materials used in the processes do not work optimally over time, leading to unwanted by-products.\nWith the CAMELEON project, our goal is to use electricity to convert methane to hydrogen and valuable ethylene. We have come up with some innovative materials of natural origin, a new type of reactor: the shock wave reactor and an electrified membrane. These will help us convert methane efficiently while extracting hydrogen. Working at high pressure, we can convert methane from natural gas pipelines to hydrogen at higher pressure to transport it to users throughout Belgium.\nThe Cameleon project has the potential to make a big difference by reducing CO2 emissions. Our method can eliminate up to 12 kg of CO2 emissions per kilogram of hydrogen produced, when compared to current production methods such as steam reforming. This is a significant reduction and helps us make this process more environmentally friendly.",

The priority for ELECTRO is the plastic waste streams that are currently not recycled but rather either incinerated or dumped to landfill: examples are multilayer plastics, mixed PE/PP/PS, and waste PS. An innovative modular extruder for optimal pre-treatment of plastic waste will be combined with an electrically heated reactor for the catalytic pyrolysis of plastic waste at TRL 7. The main product, plastic waste pyrolysis oil, will be used as a feed for steam crackers. Steam cracking will be electrified in the roto-dynamic reactor (RDR), a second novel reactor technology to be demonstrated at TRL 7 in ELECTRO. In the RDR heat transfer is accelerated by an order of magnitude compared to heat transfer rates achieved in the fired heaters used in conventional crackers. And so the RDR has a substantially higher selectivity towards light olefins and improved process efficiency. The light olefins will be further processed into PE and PP, demonstrating the technical feasibility of chemical recycling and the use of plastic waste as a circular carbon feed. This scalable concept will enable strong industrial symbiosis, with the initial LCA showing an 90% GHG reduction compared to today's best available technology (BAT). Given the amount of plastic waste that can be converted, and the market demand for the compounds produced, the impact of ELECTRO will be profound. To further extend the impact of ELECTRO, the global replicability and economic viability of the proposed concept will be demonstrated using waste streams from the Republic of Korea and Indonesia, and a thorough programme will be implemented to train the next generation of waste management engineers and workers.",

The first model will focus on the discharge section, decoupling solution of nanosecond-short electron collisions, and microsecond-short thermal chemistry. The second model will be centered around the CFD simulation of the catalytic section, where discharge effluents are converted to ethylene.

However, it faces some major environmental issues as the furnaces of the steam crackers in Flanders are responsible for 50% of the total CO2 emission of the chemical industry. \n\nA radically new reactor concept for drastic heat transfer intensification, that will be investigated in this project, is that of an electrified rotor stator reactor, a gas-turbine like design which enables temperature increases to >1000\u00b0C at an order of magnitude faster compared to state-of-the-art furnaces (from 200 ms to 10 ms based on preliminary CFD simulations), without increasing pressure. The reason for this is found in the fact that it transforms kinetic energy, obtained via the electrically driven rotor, into heat via stators while the isobaric operation is caused by enhanced mixing in the foreseen vaneless space, where also the majority of the reactions occur.\n\nIf the proposed project is successful, the valorisation potential in the petrochemical industry will be enormous as it will pave the way for a paradigm shift in the way olefins are produced; from fossil fuel combustion-based steam cracking to electrified olefins production with much higher yields (>65% increase in ethylene production from a given naphtha stream) and thereby process economics, and much lower environmental impact (90% reduction in CO2 emissions).",

Fundamental multiscale modeling will be a key ingredient to optimize existing reactor configurations, develop novel reactor concepts and eventually to scale-up these processes. Detailed microkinetic models are therefore needed, in combination with 3D particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics (CFD-DEM) to predict flow fields and transport phenomena. This research proposal is divided in three work packages: development of the CFD-DEM framework with detailed chemistry, validation by comparison with experimental data, and using the validated framework for process intensification and advanced reactor design. The main application that is considered is super-dry reforming (SDR) of methane, which recently has been patented at LCT, and which intensifies CO2 conversion by using a chemical looping approach. This allows to convert more CO2 per molecule of CH4 compared to conventional dry reforming. CFD-DEM allows to accurately design and hence also compare packed bed reactor configurations and circulating fluidized bed reactors, both of which are today being considered for SDR. Using the new CFD-DEM framework, it will be possible to design and optimize the operating conditions for SDR, hence revolutionizing the CCU field.",

The feedstock, plastic pyrolysis oil, contains a mix of hydrocarbons and heteroatomic compounds containing O, N, S, Cl and Br. These compounds originate from organic residues, additives and contamination with PVC among others. Aside from oxygen compounds, the decomposition of these heteroatomic compounds is not well known, especially when they react in the presence of a complex hydrocarbon matrix.

Models for heteroatomic model compounds will be constructed based on parameters obtained from ab initio calculations. A comprehensive kinetic model will be developed based on these model compounds and well-founded hypotheses for model size reduction. Finally, the complete model will be validated with experimental studies. This will result in optimization of thermochemical plastic recycling towards industrial application.",

The current main challenges, i.e. the purity and separation of the solid carbon product, the design of chemical reactor, a suitable liquid catalyst allowing operation at lower temperature, and avoiding CO2 emissions will be resolved in this project through a multiscale modeling approach together with experimental validation at the nano, micro and macro scale. Ab initio calculations will be performed to determine the pyrolysis reaction mechanisms for different catalyst systems including binary liquid metal catalysts, ternary liquid metal catalyst and molten salt catalyst designed based on the thermodynamic calculations. The kinetic data obtained from lab scale experiments will be used to validate the calculation results and to develop the initial kinetic model. Based on these results a kinetic model will be developed and integrated into LCT's OpenFOAM Computational Fluid dynamic framework, allowing to account for the reaction kinetics under more complex turbulent flow conditions. Finally, a novel vortex reactor will be designed to achieve a high process efficiency. This proposal focuses on fundamental research, attempting to supply deep insights into this promising technology to hydrogen economy.",

It is a technology where CO2 can be converted into oxygen on anode and valued chemical products on cathode simultaneously. Although ECO2R technology has received considerable attention recently, the related space application has rarely been evaluated. To fill this gap, this research proposal aims to evaluate the technical feasibility of a smart, sustainable, and stable ECO2R application on Mars. It provides a smart solution to produce oxygen and different chemicals, including CO, CH4, and syngas, in a single process. Therefore, the current ECO2R electrolyser structure will be first improved and demonstrated under a simulated Mars environment. Next, a more sustainable electrolyser will be developed by improving the stability of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) and the electrolyte. This experimental effort will be guided by simulation work to study the mechanism and design the cell structure. Moreover, the simulation work will provide guidelines to improve the cell performance at a more extreme condition which is beyond the lab but closer to Mars' condition. An overview of the process will be presented based on the aforementioned work, including the downstream and upstream elements with specifications for multiple mission scenarios.",

To rapidly gain knowledge and to define optimal routes to chemicals (monomers, oligomers, waxes) via catalytic and pyrolytic conversion or their combination, the established reaction engineering methodology will be applied, combining reaction chemistry and chemical engineering concepts. In other words, by performing well-chosen experiments in combination with theoretical work, even for a broad feedstock composition spectrum (e.g. depending on the plastics origin, manufacturing steps, the use of coatings, etc.) and large range of possible process conditions, optimal chemical recycling strategies will be evaluated on a large scale.

By ethnographically engaging in everyday research practice, the current project will take a close look at such an interdisciplinary R&D initiative: the Urban Waste and Circular Economy (UWCE) research consortium at Ghent University. By observing and interpreting what is happening on the one hand and feeding these findings back to the research process on the other, we not only set out to develop a groundbreaking conceptual understanding of socio-technical collaboration in terms of boundary work, but we are also convinced that this will cultivate a reflexive awareness enabling researchers to unlock the actual potential of interdisciplinarity.",

Lignin, a polymer-like structure, consisting of functionalised aromatic units, that together with cellulose and hemicellulose forms the cell wall of woody plants, gained a lot of attention because of this. Currently, vast amounts of lignin are produced as side products in industries focussing on polysaccharides such as the paper industry or the bio-ethanol producing biorefineries. However, due to the severe extraction conditions, the resulting lignin is of poor quality, which hinders valorisation through depolymerisation. Consequently, these technical lignins are almost integrally burned as low value fuels. If the depolymerisation of technical lignins to functionalised aromatic species could be achieved, the resulting products are fit to replace commodities such as phenol. This project aims at bridging the gap between technical lignins and their potential applications within the polymer industry by studying the effect of a mild soda extraction process on the lignin structure and the downstream depolymerisation of the resulting lignin through mild catalytic hydrogenolysis. Miscanthus x giganteus is chosen as a fast growing, rather easily extractable grass crop. The project employs a multidisciplinary approach and is boosted by the development of novel and innovative analytics.",

Whereas today\u2019s hybrid AI solutions embed objective knowledge into the AI, here, an approach is researched that captures the tacit knowledge of experienced engineers in a useful format to create a Knowledge Graph (KG) from, while keeping the discrepancies between experts. Uncaptured knowledge can be taken into account by enabling user feedback on the outputs of the model. However, users can give conflicting feedback. These conflicts need to be captured and resolved, by leveraging existing knowledge in the KGs, before sending it to the model for training. The resulting model predictions should also be interpretable for users, so they can give valuable feedback. This is not trivial in hybrid AI as the models use vectors, extracted from the KG, that are not interpretable for humans. Here, a generic explainability layer is investigated that can be combined with any hybrid AI outcome prediction model by designing recurrent attention models for KGs.",

Recent research advancements apply machine learning to predict the occurrence of these breakdowns. Based on the collection of historical data describing the circumstances before these malfunctions appear, models are trained to find patterns in the data that predict the remaining life time of a machine. The main drawback of these approaches is however their reliance on (lots of) data to be able to function well for many types of failures and operating conditions. Therefore, in this research proposal, I aim to guide these models to the right solution by also providing them with physical knowledge available about the machine. Engineers often have detailed knowledge about the physical behavior of the machines they design. For example, when a car engine is running, it should not exceed certain temperatures or noise levels. When it does, something is wrong with the engine, meaning that it will fail soon. Instead of having the models to learn these known patterns from historical data, we will provide them with this expert knowledge from the beginning. This enables them to learn much faster and with less data. In addition, we don't want to retrain these programs for every new environment a machine is deployed in (e.g., different weather conditions). The models should be smart enough to extrapolate important warning signs they have learned from other environments.",

In the next-step fusion device ITER, the resulting fast release of thermal and magnetic energy may lead to severe heat loads and mechanical stresses. Crucial for successful mitigation is prediction of an upcoming disruption sufficiently ahead. However, the mechanisms of a disruption are complex and current physical understanding is not sufficiently advanced to reliably predict it. In this regard, \u201cdata-driven\u201d techniques are being studied to classify the plasma state into disruptive or healthy state. Due to the diversity of disruption causes and differences from one device to another, these classification models require an unpractical training phase and yet do not generalize well, leading to high rates of false positives and false negatives. To address these issues, I will focus my research on developing machine learning techniques such as \u201canomaly detection\u201d to predict disruptions in real time, based on measurable quantities with a clear physical interpretation and normalized to guarantee machine independence. This will ensure transfer-ability of the system to an unseen device (e.g., ITER). By combining physical insight with state-of-the-art anomaly detection, a novel, robust disruption predictor is envisaged that is able to deal with measurement error and uncertainties in physical models of today, with the required universality for the fusion devices of tomorrow.",

However, translating these models into clinical practice faces significant hurdles. This research addresses the critical need for reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) in clinical ML, emphasizing the importance of conveying uncertainty to clinicians. Current approaches often provide only the \"most likely\" recommendation and prioritize population-level accuracy metrics, neglecting the unique nature of each patient and overlooking uncertainty related to model predictions. This research aims to solve these issues by achieving three main objectives. Objective 1 focuses on designing conditionally valid and efficient UQ approaches, addressing challenges related to integrating UQ into clinical ML models, and establishing reliable confidence estimates. Objective 2 explores the fusion of UQs within Hybrid ML models, aiming for more adaptive and efficient UQ in a low data regime. Objective 3 tackles the disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, acknowledging their distinct sources and characteristics. By addressing these objectives, the research aims to contribute to developing trustworthy ML systems for personalized diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment in healthcare. Ultimately, this work seeks to enhance safety and reliability, accelerating the integration of ML research into clinical practice.",

SOTA mental health research is focused on finding relationships between affective states and physiological responses. However, transitioning this knowledge to real-life settings poses several problems; (1) physiological responses do not solely depend on mental health, (2) people can be subject to intra-user variance, and (3) machine learning models are mostly black-box and therefore give little to no insights. I will tackle these problems by constructing a multimodal and dynamic hierarchical sensing framework for personalized (mental) health monitoring in real-life. Multimodal sensing will be used to detect non-physiological symptoms and thus incorporate context. The multimodality of incoming data streams will be handled by this hierarchical framework, where dynamic questioning enables capturing intra-user variance. By fusing hierarchical anomaly detection with behavior modelling, using an active learning approach, I will determine the optimal moment to gather user feedback. Finally, I will focus on providing sensible insights to both physicians and patients using expert knowledge.

Recent advancements in mHealth (mobile health) enables passive, continual and unobtrusive gathering of data with devices such as smartphones and wearables. Detection of chronic disease progression is complicated due to the difficulties of collecting high quality labeled data in real-life monitoring. Interacting with a continuous data stream is laborious and causes patients to drop out. Patient-provided labels are also subjective and prone to bias (e.g. due to memory errors). Furthermore, identifying discrepancies in individual patients is challenging as disease and human behavior changes over time, measurements are person dependent, and patients might start monitoring when they are already in an anomalous situation rendering personal discrepancies less useful. Lastly, it is difficult to learn the causal structures in data to comprehend discrepancies due to the existence of many confounders. To realize prevention with long-term health monitoring, a generic framework will be created for chronic disease monitoring. The following three research objectives are tackled 1) Personal anomaly detection for disease progression using unlabeled mHealth data; 2) Detecting discrepancy using inter and intra-personal features; and 3) Causal discovery in real-life settings through distributed heuristic approaches.",

However, intricate drivetrains are plagued by nonlinearities and uncertainties that are hard to capture with solely physical laws. Traditional data-driven techniques on the other hand can have poor extrapolation capabilities, i.e. predictions outside their training region can become progressively worse. This project proposes a dynamic hybrid modeling formalism, by intimately merging physics-based with data-driven models that aims at improved accuracy, robustness and extrapolation capabilities. Research will be devoted to inserting these formalisms into virtual scenario testing for the detection of unwanted phenomena, as well as for optimal control strategy and design of drivetrains.

An interdisciplinary team, comprising specialists in Chinese, Japanese, Latin American, Southeast Asian, economic, environmental, and medical history, maritime archaeology, and geographical sciences, will, for the first time, systematically investigate the roles of actors, objects, side-effects, and exchanges that were 'invisible' or marginal to conventional histories of the Manila Galleon trade (1565 to 1815). They will also examine informal trade routes and networks in this trans-Pacific trade connection, concentrating on the 16th to 18th centuries. To achieve this goal, this project will expand upon the structure and impacts of contraband, informal, accidental, and undesired exchanges of cargoes, people, knowledge, technologies, and diseases across the Pacific, to evaluate, first, the complexity, nature, and degree of the global interconnectivity of Asian and European sub-regional networks, and, second, to reassess both their positive and negative impacts on trans-Pacific trade generally, and on indigenous actors and societies in China, Japan, and the Viceroyalty of Peru specifically. Our aim is to replace the outdated image of the galleon trade as being a pure exchange of silks, ceramics, and spices for silver between Acapulco and Manila, and to create a novel and more comprehensive bottom-up narrative that places human-environment interaction at the core of analysis. TRANSPACIFIC will substantially transform the understanding of the trans-Pacific Manila Galleon trade and its impacts, and, in so doing, will open the way for the re-evaluation of other major trans-maritime networks.",

Rarely or never is a link provided in these applications with future development plans by policymakers, (landscape) architects, spatial planners and project developers. Little or no 3D models are also used. After all, a subject named \"future\" does not exist next to the subject \"history\" in primary school. Besides the past and the future, there is, of course, also the present. Furthermore, 3D city models increasingly form the basis for this, called Digital (geo)Twins, as a digital copy of the present situation. While more cities worldwide are committed to building digital environments, it is only about the past. Most of these timelines are still 2D applications with images and text.\nThe Department of Geography of Ghent University strives for a formulated approach to developing Spatial Time Machines.

Digital Geo-ICT techniques such as online 3D/4D, Virtual Reality, and Augmented Reality can better represent our dreams about the past and future and thus stimulate different senses, visually, auditory and eventually even the sense of smell. Movement and animation using Game Engines make the whole thing even more lively.\nThis project application aims to vulgarise the possibilities of an \"Animated Spatial Time Machine\", an essential step toward a hybrid world in which reality merges into eXtended Reality. These newly described environments are helpful for research, education, instruction, evaluation, policy decisions and interactive communication. We propose a project where we make every citizen fit their dreams into a 4D environment. This will be done through a call and a competition formula in which we trigger every citizen in the Ghent City Region to enter their dreams in a 3D drawing, with accompanying animation and storytelling. This directly stimulates policymakers, researchers, and teachers to further nurture and use those \"Animated Spatial Time Machines\" in a societal context.l Time Machines\" in a societal context.",

Cycling safety is an important factor determining adolescents\u2019 choice for a specific cycling route. With this research, cycling safety along adolescents\u2019 routes between their home and school will be analysed, both at macro- and at micro-scale.\n\nIn a first phase, cycling routes of adolescents will be analysed using data mining methods. Several potentially important environmental factors (e.g. the presence of cycle lanes, land use, street type) along their routes will be taken into account. This PhD research will evaluate which of those factors determine adolescents\u2019 route choice.\n\nIn a second phase, the collected cycling data will be used to detect dangerous intersections in the neighbourhood of schools. Video-cameras will be hung at those intersections to record interactions between the different road users. Dangerous and safe manoeuvres will be investigated. From these outcomes, several limitations of such intersections will be determined.\n\nThe results from both phases can reveal important points of interest for the environment along adolescents\u2019 cycling routes, and for specific intersections.

Therefore, the\n\n\n\ncommunication of route instructions by the navigation aid should be as effective and efficient as\n\n\n\npossible, and thus keyed to the user\u2019 local needs. This project focusses on the development and\n\n\n\nevaluation of an adaptive system, in which the communication of route instructions varies\n\n\n\naccording to the perceived level of complexity at decision points. In a first phase of the project,\n\n\n\nbuilding complexity will be derived from theoretical measures (based on space syntax theories).\n\n\n\nNext, the users\u2019actual perception regarding complexity on the same decision points will be\n\n\n\nevaluated. A match between the theoretical and perceived values will be made in order to be able\n\n\n\nto automatically calculate the perceived level of complexity at decision points. Through a number\n\n\n\nof user studies, we will derive what type of route communication (e.g. 2D or 3D maps, symbols,\n\n\n\npictures, etc.) works best at decision points with a certain level of (perceived) complexity. This \n\n\n\ninformation is combined into a navigation aid which will automatically adapt its route instructions\n\n\n\naccording to the (perceived) complexity of a certain decision point. This system will be evaluated\n\n\n\nin a real life setting in the final phase of the project.",

High quality urban parks could become an important aspect in creating healthy cities for older adults; since parks can positively impact the physical, mental and social health of their users. Unfortunately, older adults currently rarely visit parks. It is therefore important to investigate how to increase park accessibility and park visitation among this group. The purpose of this project is to conduct participatory research with older adults using innovative technologies to identify modifiable environmental attributes of parks that older adults consider important for park accessibility and park visitation. First, critical modifiable park attributes will be identified by older adults using an online interactive map. Second, the \u2018Discovery tool\u2019 app will enable older adults to take geo-encoded photographs of environmental attributes on their way to and in the park, and to comment on how these environmental attributes influence their park visit. Third, as actual changes to parks are costly and may have unanticipated side-effects, a virtual reality experiment will examine the effects of changes in critical park attributes on park accessibility and park attractiveness in older adults. The results will inform park planners on best practices to (re-)design parks in order to effectively increase older adults\u2019 park use.",

The focus will be on creating models that provide clear insights into their\u00a0\n\n\n decision-making processes, enabling businesses to make informed decisions based on model outputs.\n\n\n \u00a0\n\n\n Background:\n\n\n Machine Learning (ML) has become increasingly prevalent in business analytics, offering powerful tools for data-driven decision making. However,\u00a0many ML models function as \"black boxes,\" providing predictions without clear explanations of how these outcomes were reached. This lack of\u00a0transparency hinders trust and limits the adoption of such models, especially in critical business decisions where accountability is essential.\n\n\n \u00a0\n\n\n Methodology:\n\n\n The study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis with qualitative insights:\n\n\n \u00a0\n\n\n 1. Literature Review: A comprehensive review of current literature on explainable AI (XAI), focusing on techniques applicable to business\u00a0\n\n\n analytics, will be conducted to establish a theoretical foundation.\n\n\n \u00a0\n\n\n 2. Model Development: Based on the literature review, several XAI models will be developed or adapted for application in business analytics\u00a0\n\n\n scenarios. These models will aim to strike a balance between predictive performance and interpretability.\n\n\n \u00a0\n\n\n 3. Case Studies: Collaborations with industry partners will provide real-world datasets and business problems for case studies. These studies\u00a0will test the developed models' ability to deliver accurate, actionable insights while providing clear explanations of their decision-making\u00a0processes.\n\n\n \u00a0\n\n\n 4.

Yet, the genetic programs controlling these life cycle stages are poorly understood. Moreover, observations of sex in natural samples are notoriously rare. In this project, I will generate a phylum-wide atlas of gene expression during the different stages of sexual development, covering seven different species. Next, I will use comparative genomics to identify and prioritize sexual genes that are either characteristic of a single phylogenetic clade or conserved in all diatoms. Additionally, I aim to distinguish cell fates based on their transcriptional fingerprint by pioneering single-cell RNA sequencing for diatoms. To functionally characterize cell type-specific genes, fluorescent reporter lines will be generated. Finally, I will apply conserved genetic biomarkers to monitor global marine metatranscriptomes and identify the environmental conditions promoting sex. In pursuit of new insights into the diversity of life cycle regulation in unicellular eukaryotes, this project will contribute new techniques and cell type-defining genes that will play a critical role in future studies.",

The aims of this project consisted of two parts: one is the study of how transcriptional regulation and gene expression is organized across the genome. The second consists of applying the obtained datasets to assign function to TFs and their target genes with previously unknown function. The research presented in this thesis starts with the development of a phylogenetic footprinting approach for the identification of conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) in Arabidopsis thaliana using genomic information of 12 dicot plants. In this approach both alignment and non-alignment-based techniques were applied to identify functional motifs in a multi-species context. The method accounts for incomplete motif conservation as well as high sequence divergence between related species. In total, we identified 69,361 footprints associated with 17,895 genes. A gene regulatory network was compiled, through the integration of known TFBS obtained from literature and experimental studies, containing 40,758 interactions, of which two-thirds act through binding events located in DNase I hypersensitive sites. This network shows significant enrichment towards in vivo targets of known regulators and its overall quality was confirmed using five different biological validation metrics. Finally, a proof of concept experiment using detailed expression and function information was performed to demonstrate how static CNSs can be converted into condition-dependent regulatory networks, offering new opportunities for regulatory gene annotation. In a subsequent analysis, we applied the aforementioned phylogenetic footprinting framework to ten dicot plants for the identification of CNSs. This yielded 1,032,291 CNSs associated with 243,187 genes. To annotate these CNSs with TFBSs, we made use of binding site information of 642 TFs originating from 35 TF families in Arabidopsis. Validation of the obtained CNSs was performed using TF chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data from three species, resulting in significant overlap for the majority of datasets. We also identified ultra-conserved CNSs by including genomes of additional plant families and identified 715 binding sites for 501 genes conserved in dicots, monocots, mosses and green algae. Through application of the obtained CNSs we found that genes part of conserved miniregulons have a higher coherence in their expression profile than other divergent gene pairs. Next, a novel algorithm was developed that supports both alignment-free and alignment-based conserved motif discovery in the promoter sequences of closely related species. Putative motifs are exhaustively enumerated as words over the IUPAC alphabet and screened for conservation using the branch length score. Because of the exhaustive character of the algorithm and great resource needs, the MapReduce programming model was adopted to take advantage of a cloud computing infrastructure and handle these requirements efficiently. The method was applied to four monocotyledon plant species and we were able to show that high-scoring motifs are significantly enriched for open chromatin regions in Oryza sativa and for transcription factor binding sites inferred through protein-binding microarrays in Oryza sativa and Zea mays. Furthermore, the method was shown to recover ga2ox1-like KN1 binding sites in Zea mays experimentally profiled through ChIP-Seq. Finally, a target gene identification analysis for 12 NAM-ATAF1/2-CUC2 (NAC) transcription factors was performed. NAC transcription factors are among the largest transcription factor families in plants, yet limited data exists from unbiased approaches to resolve the DNA-binding preferences of individual members. We used a TF-target gene identification workflow based on the integration of novel protein binding microarray data with gene expression and multi-species promoter sequence conservation to identify the DNA-binding specificities and the underlying gene regulatory networks. The data offers specific single base resolution fingerprints for most TFs studied and indicates that NAC DNA binding specificities might be predicted from their DNA binding domain\u2019s sequence. The developed methodology, including the application of complementary functional genomics filters, makes it possible to translate, for each TF, protein binding microarray data into a set of high-quality target genes. NAC target genes reported from independent in vivo analyses were confirmed to be detected by this approach.",

While singe-cell profiling is booming in the medical field, technology optimization focusing on plant cells is ongoing. In the UGent/VIB Department of Plant Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, a single-cell platform was established for academic and industrial collaborations, focusing on single-cell technology implementation/benchmarking and end-to-end services. Additionally, the AgBio Accelerator was created to allow interested industrial partners to join forces with the department, unite expertise, and evaluate and de-risk novel technologies for plant breeding companies. The next challenge is gaining access to cost-effective and efficient methods to extract biological insights from these complex single-cell data sets. Given that gene discovery is an essential aspect of plant breeding programs in agricultural biotechnology (AgBio), there is urgent need for easy-to-use and efficient tools to combine single-cell RNA-Seq data and gene-trait information to identify new genes for crop improvement.\nIn this project we aim to develop a software tool (scTrait) to improve gene-trait discovery and prioritization starting from scRNA-seq data. First, we will collect, integrate, and curate gene-trait information from different sources. Next, we will apply network biology algorithms to leverage single-cell data, gene trait information and orthology data, with the final goal to improve and speed-up gene discovery and prioritization for specific plant traits. Apart from building a curated plant gene-trait database and developing the scTrait software tool (two main targets for valorization), the tool performance to identify and prioritize genes covering specific plant traits will be evaluated in a first proof-of-concept (PoC). In a second PoC, we will generate new scRNA-seq datasets for a selection of economically important plants to evaluate the power and applicability of our scTrait software in crops. Here, the goal is to demonstrate the potential of the software to attract and convince AgBio companies.\nTaken together, the development of efficient tools for plant data analysis, embracing the power of cutting-edge new technologies like single-cell sequencing and semantic data integration, will improve and speed-up gene discovery and prioritization for plant breeding. Providing PoC for a variety of crops offers ample opportunities for valorization, either via licenses, research collaborations or spinning out of a company.\nA graphical abstract was uploaded showing the relationships between the different WPs, Milestones and PoCs.",

The life cycle is often described as a \u2018sex clock\u2019, and for a long time was hypothesized to be a self-sustained periodic process. Recent models, however, suggest that environmental conditions triggering sexual reproduction are necessary to sustain the periodicity of the clock. Nonetheless, knowledge on the relationship between environmental conditions, cell size distribution and sexual reproduction is scarce. In this PhD project I will use six raphid benthic diatoms to (1) conduct physiological experiments to assess the effect of environmental conditions on sexual reproduction, (2) generate sex transcriptomes and conduct comparative sequence analysis to elucidate genes and genetic pathways underlying raphid diatom sexual reproduction, (3) develop a methodology to detect natural sexual events and (4) link those to observations of temporal variation in population density, cell size distribution and seasonal changes in environmental conditions. Together, this will gain new insights about the genes, pathways and environmental cues controlling sexual reproduction in benthic diatoms, both in the lab and in the wild.",

We focus on diatoms, the most diverse group of algae on Earth and playing a key role in aquatic ecosystems as primary producers and the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and silica. We will use the globally distributed, benthic marine diatom Seminavis robusta as a model system. Earlier research suggests extensive cryptic species diversity within this and related species. We will first document global species diversity using automated molecular species delimitation and generate a phylogenetic backbone to provide first insights into the evolutionary relationships among them. Whole genome re-sequencing of selected strains will be used to infer the history of diversification within the complex and to study the nature and degree of pan-genomic differentiation among cryptic species. In parallel, experimental studies will be set up for these strains to quantify the strength of intrinsic reproductive barriers and to characterize divergence in the pheromone signaling cascade. Combined, our results will to reveal the importance of interspecific hybridization and adaptive evolution in this species complex.",

However, these techniques are carried out on digested tissue samples and don\u2019t give any information on the precise location of cells. Unfortunately, to fully understand how cellular biology functions, one needs to position the cells in their spatial context. For any cell type, in any species, one needs to know which cells are in the vicinity of the cell of interest. Localising cell types is typically done by antibody-based staining and microscopy. Unfortunately, antibodies are not always available to study specific cell types. Luckily, spatial transcriptomic techniques can now determine the spatial expression of multiple RNA molecules in parallel. As this methodology is based on universal RNA detection, it is applicable across all species: in humans, mammals and plants. The next frontier in single-cell biology is therefore to resolve the precise spatial location of each single cell, so that we can finally understand the tissue architecture for each organ and identify the local cell-cell circuits that control cell fate and functional specialization in health and disease across species. With the SpatialConnect consortium we will build a cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics infrastructure at the Ghent University.",

Due to environmental concerns, rice cultivation is shifted from flooded fields to well-drained soils, which poses problems with soil-bound nematodes (and other diseases) that majorly jeopardize rice yield. Plants have many mechanisms to defend themselves against these nematodes and other parasites. They even have a \u2018memory\u2019 that allows them to react more quickly and effectively to a reoccurring attack. Interestingly, it has recently been discovered that in some cases plants can transfer their stress-memory to their progeny, which then also exhibits a better stress tolerance or resistance. Subjecting a plant to stress to \u2018arm\u2019 it against future stress is termed \u2018priming\u2019. In this proposal, priming of plants by applying stress to their parents will be indicated as \u2018transgenerational priming\u2019. Currently, much remains unknown about the mechanisms behind transgenerational priming. However, it has been shown that it is not passed on in a genetic way, but through epigenetics: a regulatory layer above the genome that determines which parts of the information encoded in our DNA will be used to build our cells. Many of the epigenetic mechanisms rely on a certain type of RNA-molecules, termed non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). This project aims at identifying a subset of these ncRNAs and their function in nematode-induced transgenerational priming in rice.",

This is because these techniques are prone to \u2018plug-in\u2019 bias and drastically complicate inference. However, recent work has shown how data-adaptive methods can be used in a first step for evaluating the effect of an intervention, whilst still yielding valid confidence intervals. These results nevertheless hold under strong conditions on the first-step methods, which are not designed for causal effect estimation and are thus sub-optimal. Proposals also focus on simple causal inquiries (e.g. the effect of binary interventions) or rely on modelling assumptions to \u2018summarise\u2019 the causal effect, at the risk of bias due to misspecification. We will first investigate how to target the data-adaptive methods with the purpose of reducing the bias of the causal effect estimator. Our fitting strategies will also yield valid confidence intervals under much weaker assumptions than current proposals. We will then develop new model-free causal estimands that are useful in a variety of contexts and facilitate nonparametric inference using data-adaptive techniques. Finally, we will use these insights to make optimal \u2018counterfactual\u2019 predictions at the individual level under specific, planned interventions.",

In this project, we will develop a data-informed system to assist personalized treatment decision-making based on predictions of what a patient\u2019s outcome would be if one of multiple treatment options were considered. These predictions will be based on available EHRs, but unlike standard predictions, will consider the causal structure of the problem and account for confounding bias. In addition, we will develop a novel study design for optimizing these predictions, by supplementing the EHR data with data from small, targeted randomized experiments integrated into routine practice. Randomized experimentation enables the system to continuously learn and wash away possible (unmeasured) confounding bias present in routine EHRs. We will apply (part of) the methodology to develop an expert system for psoriasis based on the PsoPlus registry.",

This waste represents tens of billions of Euros spent each year on studies that are redundant, flawed in their design, never published or poorly reported. The public is the main victim of this waste. If clinical research is not adequately planned, conducted and reported, clinicians are prevented from using effective health interventions in practice and researchers from adequately prioritizing future research questions. This situation ultimately has a detrimental impact on patient care. Therefore, reducing waste and increasing value of research represents a major societal challenge. Our aim is to create an innovative and ambitious multidisciplinary intersectoral joint doctoral training programme in Europe dedicated to Methods in Research on Research (MiRoR) in the field of clinical research. \u201cResearch on Research (RoR)\u201d is an emerging new scientific discipline that aims to reduce waste in research and increase research value.  MiRoR brings together 7 world-class research teams in various disciplines (computer sciences, applied mathematics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, clinical epidemiology, psychology, social sciences and translational medicine) from 6 different European countries; 6 non-academic partners involved in diverse sectors, and 4 major academic partners. We tackle several steps of a clinical research project (planning, conduct, reporting and the peer-review); various study designs (observational studies, randomised trials, systematic reviews); and various study questions (therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic evaluation) using various methods (scoping reviews, meta-epidemiologic studies, qualitative studies, experimental studies, simulations etc). Our project involving 15 early-stage researchers aims to: 1) Prepare students for envisioning the future challenges in clinical research and find innovative solutions to face them; 2)Train students to go beyond the state-of-the-art in their research; 3) Help students think differently, taking advantage of the multidisciplinary expertise and intercultural diversity of the network; 4) Teach students how to move from research to action and convert knowledge and ideas into a product; 5) Help students develop skills to match the public and private sector needs and create new professional opportunities.",

It is tempting to do this using existing data adaptive methods (e.g. machine learning), but these are prone to regularization bias, drastically complicate inference, and are moreover not designed for effect estimation and therefore sub-optimal. Furthermore, whilst inferring population-level causal effects is useful, further patientspecific information is generally needed to inform decision making. We will first investigate how to target machine learning methods with the purpose of optimizing estimation and inference for the treatment effect. Specifically, we will develop fitting strategies that yield efficient treatment effect estimators along with honest confidence intervals under weaker assumptions than current proposals. Because all confounders are unlikely to be measured, we will then propose novel treatment effect estimators for case-only designs that automatically control for time-fixed confounders.

These restrictions impede their applications in many realistic settings, and when improperly used can lead to severely incorrect results even with just two mediators. Building on novel definitions of causal direct and indirect effects, I proposed estimators that do not have these restrictions. As an FWO postdoc, I will develop methods for two common and important settings in psychology and education research with more complex data structures: longitudinal mediators and multilevel data. Extensions for these settings are difficult, because they require carefully (i) adjusting for complex but unknown confounding patterns among the mediators, and (ii) conceptualizing multipart causal effects that are simultaneously transmitted within and between individuals. I will define causal effects, and propose estimators that rely on minimal assumptions for valid inference.

The screw needs to be placed completely within the bone or else it could lead to cartilage damage in the wrist. Due to the complicated anatomy of the wrist and the small incision, the surgeon cannot get a clear view of where the screw should go in the bone and errors are common. To address this concern, computers have been used to assist surgeons by showing an existing CT or MRI image of the wrist along with its relation to the actual patient. Unfortunately, these computer systems are limited in that they require the wrist not move during the surgery, and they require the surgeon to define how the CT or MRI image maps onto the patient\u2019s anatomy.\n\nIn this project, we intend to improve the efficiency and accuracy of wrist fracture surgeries by tracking the motion of the patient\u2019s hand, then using augmented reality (AR) to display the CT or MRI image directly on the patient.

Due to recent data abuse scandals, there is an increasing push towards the decentralization of data on the Web into a large number of user-owned data vaults. While query engines are typically used for interacting with data due to their ability to abstract the complexities behind data access, they are optimized for centralized data storage. To build usable applications over decentralized data, new querying algorithms for massively distributed data are needed. The recent link traversal query execution paradigm is a promising match, as I have shown that it can effectively discover data over large decentralized environments during query execution. However, it is often too slow due to a lack of query planning algorithms that are compatible with this live data discovery aspect. Hence, I will introduce new query planning algorithms that can adaptively optimize the query plan upon discovery of structural information and heterogeneous interfaces within decentralized environments. To evaluate these algorithms, I will compare them to existing approaches by simulating realistic decentralized environments. In general, adaptive query plan optimization upon live discovered sources will be the primary academic breakthrough of this research, which is an open problem in Semantic Web research, and an urgent need by decentralized application developers and organizations.",

This centralization is bad for the web and its users, there is a need to decentralize the web again. The Solid initiative is one such decentralization initiatives rapidly gaining support. The initiative strives to provide a personal data store to each user. These stores differ both in data stored by the user, and interface exposed. Heterogeneity is key for decentralization, but makes interacting with data stores complex for data consumers. There is a need to abstract these complexities, shielding consumers from the heterogeneity inherent to decentralization. Previous and ongoing research focusing on abstracting read queries proves to be successful. No research has been done to abstract updates to these data stores, but updates are essential to data management. In this PhD project, I focus on abstracting update queries over a permissioned decentralized environment, optimizing write performance. To do so, I research the requirements on interfaces, interface trade-offs, transactions, and query processing techniques. Future research will be able to refine the algorithms I propose and create alternatives. In research about read-queries, adaptive query planning seems promising. Future research might try to incorporate that idea in update-queries.",

My proposed Ph.D. aims to improve the connectivity and shareability of genomic data storage(s), while preserving data privacy, to decrease the costs of patient genome data use in clinical practice. I propose a citizen-centric storage framework that integrates insights from various semantic web domains research into a novel, practical solution for clinical use.

In recent years, this Web has become increasingly centralized by large companies, which are causing significant political and social problems. As such, many efforts are going on to re-decentralize the Web, which requires new technologies to maintain the applications that currently depend on this centralization. As applications currently require data to be centralized in a few large data sources for querying, decentralization leads many small data sources, which can not be queried efficiently by current algorithms. My objective is to investigate ways to query data on the Web without having to centralize data into a few large query endpoints. I will do this by investigating link-traversal-based query processing, which exploits the linked nature of data on the Web, and gives clients control over querying instead of servers. I will improve upon the performance of existing link-traversal technologies by allowing query engines to be guided towards query-relevant documents in a more intelligent manner. Furthermore, I will design hybrid algorithms that combine this link-traversal with querying using existing centralized query endpoints, which will offer trade-offs to achieve the best of both approaches. I will evaluate my algorithms by simulating realistic Web environments, and comparing to existing approaches. With this research, applications over decentralized environments can be built, based on efficient query execution.",

We aim (1) to demonstrate that devising a novel interoperable scholarly communication infrastructure is feasible by leveraging existing technologies and standards, and (2) to deliver a technical blueprint for a future decentralized and decoupled scholarly Web. Our explorations will take the current environment into account so that results will be usable to improve upon the existing communication system.

Semantic web reasoning has proven to be ideal for targeting Variety, enabling the integration of data from various sources. However, reasoning is too computationally expensive, compared to the velocity of the IoT. Therefore, a paradigm shift is happening from cloud computing towards computing the data as close as possible to its source, i.e. at the edge. The objective of this proposal is to enable efficient and scalable real-time processing of IoT data with Cascading Reasoning (CR), i.e. a layered reasoning approach consisting of various levels of complexity. CR naturally matches the edge processing paradigm, as the low-complexity processing techniques can be pushed down to the edge, while complex layers can be processed on intermediate & cloud nodes with more resources. Due to the size and complexity of the edge environment, it is extremely hard for users to issue efficient queries across such a CR layered framework. I will investigate how queries can be optimized and automatically translated to the various levels of the cascade to enable efficient and real-time edge analytics. As IoT data requires to solve an integration problem, efficient reasoning techniques will be investigated that can deal with the velocity, volume, and variety of IoT data.",

The test quantifies cochlear synaptopathy, i.e. damage to the cochlear auditory-nerve fiber synapses due to ageing, noise-exposure or ototoxicity, with a non-invasive auditory EEG test. Because synaptopathy is associated with reduced speech intelligibility and occurs before the audiogram shows signs of hearing damage, our test is more sensitive than the audiogram (present clinical standard) and can quantify a widespread form of sensorineural hearing loss. The CochSyn test makes early-diagnosis and early-intervention possible, which the WHO determined as cost-effective in reducing the financial burden associated with untreated hearing loss. In this PoC project, we plan to fine-tune the CochSyn-test and build a normative dataset of test outcomes (N=300) for a diverse population of people at risk for synaptopathy. This dataset is necessary to (i) determine the application area of the test and enable a precise diagnostic interpretation, (ii) convince ENT doctors about adopting the test and companies to invest in it, and (iii), convince health agencies and policy makers that synaptopathy is an important health risk, given its impact on degrading speech intelligibility in noisy listening environments.",

Yet, hearing impairment is inadequately diagnosed and treated because we fail to understand how the components that constitute a hearing loss impact robust speech encoding. A recent and ground-breaking discovery in animal physiology demonstrated the existence of a noise-induced hearing deficit -cochlear neuropathy- that coexists with the well-studied cochlear gain loss deficit known to degrade the audibility of sound. Cochlear neuropathy is thought to impact robust encoding of the audible portions of speech and occurs before standard hearing screening methods indicate problems, implying that a large group of noiseexposed people with self-reported hearing problems is currently not screened, nor treated. To design effective hearing restoration strategies, it is crucial to understand how cochlear neuropathy interacts with other hearing deficits to affect robust speech encoding in every-day listening conditions. Through an interdisciplinary approach, RobSpear targets hearing deficits along the ascending stages of the auditory pathway to revolutionize how hearing impairment is diagnosed and treated. RobSpear can yield immense reductions of health care costs through effective treatment of currently misdiagnosed patients and studies the impact of noiseinduced hearing deficits on our society. To achieve this, RobSpear: (i) Builds a hearing profile that, based on a computational model of the auditory periphery, develops physiological measures that differentially diagnose hearing deficits in listeners with mixtures of deficits. (ii) Designs individually tailored speech enhancement algorithms that work in adverse conditions and target perceptually relevant speech features, using an unprecedented validation approach that combines novel psychoacoustic and physiological metrics.",

Because these elements have different functional roles for hearing, their damage needs to be individually characterized and taken into account in therapeutic interventions. Differential diagnosis is possible in controlled animal experiments via post-mortem histology, but is much harder to achieve in humans where unknown mixtures of SNHL need to be quantified non-invasively.\nTo translate findings from the animal domain to humans, we adopt a computational model of the auditory periphery which integrates the histopathology and physiology of hearing to predict how human physiological responses are affected by SNHL. We focus on simultaneously modeling the neural generators of auditory evoked potentials, otoacoustic emissions and the middle-ear-muscle-reflex. A single framework which connects the generators of all three physiological responses does not exist but forms the scientific breakthrough opportunity, as data from several animal studies on SNHL can be combined to identify and study candidate physiological markers for human diagnostics. The resulting model will be used to (i) simulate and test how single SNHL profiles affect physiological responses differently, and (ii), study how SNHL affects sound processing along the ascending auditory pathway.",

For the development of more effective therapies, we need to fully understand the regulatory mechanisms at play. Increasing amount of single cell omics analyses allow to dissect complex tissues into specific cell states with their own gene regulatory networks (GRNs). I hypothesize that a spectrum of cell state-specific GRNs determines regulatory heterogeneity and plasticity in GBM and that advanced computational methodologies are needed to elucidate this regulatory heterogeneity. First, I will benchmark several scalable, state-of-the-art network inference methods for patient-specific and cell state-specific GRNs. The best performing methods will subsequently be used in an innovative meta-analysis to integrate single cell omics across tumors to generate a comprehensive spectrum of cell state-specific GRNs. I will also develop an expandable, deep learning framework for the same purpose. Next, I will study the higher order organization of these cell state-specific GRNs towards multicellular programs. Finally, I will validate in silico and in vitro the accuracy of predicted key regulators and pathways from patient- and cell-state specific GRNs in CRISPRi and drugging experiments. In the longer term identified key regulators and druggable network dependencies will contribute to novel therapeutic opportunities for GBM patients.",

Radiation therapy (RT), a cornerstone of the current standard-of-care, was previously shown to fuel GBM tumour cell plasticity and drive resistance. The identification of suitable targets that caninterfere with GBM plasticity and radiation-induced resistance, could therefore improve the effectiveness of RT and as such increase the effectiveness of the current standard-of-care in patients. Here, we will subject a set of representative patient-derived GBM models to state-of-theart radiation modalities (photon and carbon-ion radiation). These sampleswill then be subjected to extensive (spatial) single-cell multi-omics and their underlying regulatory programs will be characterized to identify druggable pathways to target radiation-induced resistance in a patient-tailored way.",

The digitization and online availability of herbaria have led to a growing need for automated tools to enrich these collections. Studying herbarium sheets involves significant manual labor, as they typically contain no morphological information about the specimens and their organs. Current herbarium processing methods are either not granular enough, inaccurate, or only work for a limited number of species. We aim to solve these issues by developing robust computer vision methods to process and analyze herbarium specimens. We will leverage the millions of publicly available herbarium images paired with taxonomic information to develop a novel vision transformer that generalizes to a broad range of species. We will use this model to fully segment herbarium sheets, producing specimen and plant organ masks (leaves, fruits, etc.). From these segments, we will extract morphological features that are crucial for understanding ecological contexts. Our existing expertise in this field forms the foundation for this research and we will use the novel digital specimen standards proposed in DiSSCo and TDWG. By applying our methods to millions of publicly available herbarium sheets and integrating the results into these repositories, we enable researchers to efficiently study historical biodiversity and environmental conditions.",

In order to cope with this issue, the FED-tWIN project will focus on the development of an end-to-end solution for the analysis, annotation and publication of the data contained in the collections and will try to offer a technical answer to a number of the challenges facing museum staff in the digital age. Fully understanding the end user\u2019s needs/tasks, defining the most important features to describe an artwork (and more specifically its composition), opening the relevant metadata in a standardized manner, and being able to perform federated queries across collections using natural language are the challenges that will be tackled in this long-term collaboration between the RMFAB and Ghent University\u2019s IDLab research group.In the initial years of their FED-tWIN collaboration, the RMFAB and IDLab UGent will join forces in a pilot project that focuses on automatic detection and annotation of saints in paintings. The project aims to cover not just the purely descriptive level of the iconography, but also the hidden meaning (the actual subject) of what is depicted. Such automations can greatly speed up the registrars\u2019 manual work process. In addition, these annotations will be linked with internationally standardised controlled vocabularies such as ICONCLASS within the RMFAB tailor-made wikibase. Both actions will help to increase the interoperability of the data contained in the collections and facilitate its digital dissemination and visibility among a large audience. In order to facilitate the retrieval of RMFAB collection items, end-user focused search mechanisms will also be investigated and evaluated. These tools will run on top of the wikibase and will support federated, intuitive querying in different languages.In the second research phase (after 5 years) the scope will be extended to the other sub-collections and infrastructures within the RMFAB. A tool will be developed to search all existing digitized RMFAB sources (various carriers/formats via data, text and image recognition) in one internal search. Furthermore, multimodal cross-collection linking will be supported in this phase. This effort should be seen as the first step towards making future data crossing possible between the Federal Scientific Institutions, and later expanding this at a broader national, European and even global level. Once this has been achieved, the way will be open to connect to international projects and achieve unprecedented research results and presentations.The proposed cooperation will raise the awareness of the usefulness of digital art history and of AI and the semantic web in the study and curation of digital heritage collections.",

Based on these scores, users will get personalized feedback, enabling them to brush in a more correct way and to maintain their oral health during the orthodontic treatment. By introducing this application, the oral health specialist (orthodontist, dentist or oral hygienist) will not lose time by explaining correct brushing behaviors to the patients over and over again (i.e. specialist will be able to see more patients per hour). Moreover, the MOoiZO!? application perfectly fits in the current tendency to invest in teleconsultations as part of the healthcare pathway. Moreover, it could result in a more efficient treatment of the orthodontic patient as the use of the app will lead to a decrease in the number of progression-inhibiting oral health issues. As such, MOoiZO!? could be of major interest as a tool to assist both the oral health specialist and the patient.",

The physical and mental health and fitness of military personnel is paramount for the efficiency of the core business of this Organisation. Attrition in recruits, the burden of burnout, inadequate fitness levels and food intake, fatigue, injuries and diseases can challenge the efficiency of the Organisation. Timely detection of what could go wrong is not easy. It is, for example, difficult to accurately monitor performance/fatigue (and detect health-related issues) and there are also still a lot of injuries amongst recruits and military personnel. STATS will investigate how objectively measured sensor data and specific military performance assessments can ease/facilitate the early detection of suboptimal function and dysfunction at physical, mental or health level.\nThe fully automated continuous collection of data with wearables and a data transmission system with an AI-based platform for \u201cblended coaching\u201d must guarantee that this approach is applicable for large numbers of individuals. In the blended coaching system, the professional experts in the different pillars are supported by AI-algorithms, though it is the expert who takes the decisions and who is in the driving seat. We are convinced that process knowledge is of crucial importance. The quantity of data will never compensate for the lack of quality and the absence of process knowledge. Blended coaching allows professional experts to manage large numbers of individuals, i.e. STATS will bring the resulting information to professionals in 4 pillars (physical fitness, mental readiness, infection risks and nutrition & hydration) and facilitate their tasks. By participation of defence experts (from HMRA-MHRA + in-kind commitment of VIPER/RMA) that are active in each of these pillars, the ROI will also be very high.\nSince we are aware of the obstacles associated with collecting and interpreting accurate large datasets, an important aspect of STATS will be to make the sensors and platform ready-to-implement in a military setting. In the different project phases we will iteratively decrease the workload for staff/soldiers by:\n\u00a0\u00a0 - easing the process to capture/collect data,\n\u00a0\u00a0 - limiting the amount of wearables/devices (end goal: all-in-one),\n\u00a0\u00a0 - providing one central platform with data of the 4 pillars,\n\u00a0\u00a0 - making the visualisations/results easy to interpret.\nBy means of active learning, the platform will over time also limit the interactions/interventions by experts to those that really matter at that moment. In this way we aim to go from a 1-on-1 advice to a 1-on-100 support - creating more time to focus on those individuals who really need support.",

From the 16th century onwards, in present-day Belgium, handwritten local maps were produced in great numbers, followed by the famous Ferraris and printed Vandermaelen map series, as well as large numbers of large or medium scale cadastral maps. What is left of this unique heritage is dispersed over public and private collections, making users of digital historical maps struggle to use these maps to their full potential. Artemis is convinced that this wealth of detailed maps and map series has great potential to investigate landscapes, their evolution over time and their possible future(s) - a potential that could be used in varying fields of research such as Historical Geography, Ecology (biodiversity and water management) and Spatial Planning. Artemis aims to process, digitally enrich, make available and valorize well-defined corpora of both handwritten and printed maps before ca. 1880, using state of the art extraction techniques - as automated localization, toponym recognition and (landscape) feature extraction - with in finality, publication in a IIIF-enabled Linked Open Data Research Infrastructure.

While biomass and abundance of particles within a detected size range can be captured very well with automated image classification, predictions on species identity are often unreliable and/or of low taxonomic resolution. High taxonomic resolution can be obtained with DNA-based approaches, but these perform suboptimal with respect to quantification of abundance or biomass. Appreciating the complementarity of both biodiversity estimation methodologies, we propose to make an integrated pipeline that exploits the strengths and complements the limitations of both approaches. Environmental parameters are also important sample descriptors that relate to the biodiversity at a certain location and will be integrated as well.\nAn extensive collection of validated plankton images generated with a FlowCAM device is already available. Additional context data and DNA samples will be collected monthly in predefined locations in the Belgian part of the North Sea. To develop the pipeline, a deep learning image classification algorithm will be used as starting point, and will be augmented with new input data, side-channel information and an adapted network architecture. As such we will be able to make more accurate plankton image classifications with higher taxonomic resolution than current state- of-the-art procedures.",

Whereas today\u2019s hybrid AI solutions embed objective knowledge into the AI, here, an approach is researched that captures the tacit knowledge of experienced engineers in a useful format to create a Knowledge Graph (KG) from, while keeping the discrepancies between experts. Uncaptured knowledge can be taken into account by enabling user feedback on the outputs of the model. However, users can give conflicting feedback. These conflicts need to be captured and resolved, by leveraging existing knowledge in the KGs, before sending it to the model for training. The resulting model predictions should also be interpretable for users, so they can give valuable feedback. This is not trivial in hybrid AI as the models use vectors, extracted from the KG, that are not interpretable for humans.

However, only recently, the model has been applied to intermittent exercise, making it a hot topic again for sport and exercise scientists. This modern application bears the potential to predict changes in the energy balance of an individual at any time point during exercise. Insight into this balance is of paramount interest to athletes who want to pace their race in an optimal way, but just as much for physiotherapists who need to prescribe rehabilitation programs tailored to the patient. Nevertheless, in spite of the broad spectrum of applications, especially given the emergence of sports wearables which can provide real-time feedback, current modelling of the energy balance is insufficient and lacks fundamental knowledge of the underlying physiology. Although the consumption of energy can be easily determined, quantification of its recharge is much more complex. During the past years, we have thoroughly investigated this recovery and acquired important insights into its physiological determinants. However, we still miss essential information before a true predictive model with strong practical feasibility can be developed. The present project therefore builds on this research with the goal of developing and validating an innovative model that enables the real-time prediction of energy balance during exercise.",

In an agriculture, these target processes are generally complex and influenced by a multitude of internal (e.g. genetics, physiology, history) and external (e.g. contexts, management) factors, rendering simple time series models insufficiently accurate. One solution is via the integration of expert knowledge in the analytics to achieve better interpretation of time-series data. In this project, I will build a data-analytics framework implemented in an open software library that explicitly integrates different sources of expert knowledge in a state estimation model. To this end, I will model (1) theory and domain expertise, (2) context and control measures, and (3) historical data patterns and incorporate these in a hidden Markov and other state-estimation models. Initially, the framework is developed with a focus on animal production based on 2 concrete case studies, but its implementation will allow for extension towards a variety of agricultural applications.

For this reason, there is a growing demand for timber identification tools that can be applied by law enforcement officers.\u00a0\nThe Tervuren xylarium is the Belgian governmental collection of wood samples. It is an internationally renown part of the federal scientific heritage, housed by the Royal Museum for Central Africa and comprises reference material of 13 000 different botanical species. One of the growing actual functions of the collection is supporting forensic research through verification of a species\u2019 identity. The most common technique of timber identification is a wood anatomical assessment. Machine Learning methods are likely to be able to assist the wood identification process for non-specialists. Wood species have indeed characteristic features at different microscopical magnifications. However, some of those features are highly variable, which hampers the development of classical dichotomy identification keys that can be used by non-specialists. Moreover, many features seen on wood surfaces are to be understood as artifacts (fissures, traces of mechanical damage, fungi and insect attacks) and are not always easy to distinguish from diagnostic characteristics for the untrained eye. The Tervuren xylarium offers the most complete assemblage of reference material for the development of new wood identification \u00a0approaches.\nThe project proposal aims at automating part of the wood identification process by applying artificial intelligence techniques for the analysis of wood anatomical images of timber species of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The tree flora of Central Africa comprises 3013 species, 27 of these belong to the class 1 commercial timber species of the DRC and are actually intensively logged and traded, 20 to class 2 (have potentially a big commercial value), 44 to class 3 (are considered to be promoted) and 879 to class 4 (commercial value is not yet known). \u00a0The project will use xylarium samples of all the species of the four classes and will take advantage of the power of modern deep learning approaches. The project will rely on expert wood anatomical descriptions which will serve as annotated training data to develop the software. The project will be unique because of the large number of African species, the application of deep learning and a database of standardized descriptions that will become available. In a first work package expert annotations of microscopic and mesoscopic images of transverse surfaces of 1000 Congolese wood species will be made. Work package 2 will develop an image processing pipeline for semi-automated annotation of microscopic and mesoscopic wood sections. Work package 3 \u00a0will focus on the production of a user-friendly interface.",

Furthermore, device discovery and service orchestration will be assisted by novel AI algorithms and optimized neural network models, while new approaches for decentralized learning will extend flexible computation and orchestration all the way to microcontrollers. Finally, the project also aims to use device attestation and a newly developed approach for decentralized container networking to create a secure environment for edge service execution and communication.",

Recently, single-cell sequencing has emerged as a way of characterizing biology with higher resolution, facilitating the construction of more comprehensive models. The technology has inherent limitations due to the lower amount of genetic material used, making the obtained data more noisy and incomplete. Current imputation and denoising methods fail to (1) contextualize predictions by modeling interactions both between cells and between biological properties of each cell and (2) incorporate the network structure of biological systems. In this proposed research project, we aim to solve these issues through the use of neural networks that mimic graph structure (i.e. transformers). These models scale quadratically with input size, making them computationally infeasible on high-dimensional sequencing data. Consequently, the main challenge is in the design of biologically-informed inductive biases, reducing the complexity while maintaining comparable performance. The proposed framework is generic in nature and is therefore expected to capture the intricacies of molecular life in a more meaningful way than current approaches. Because of this, its applicability in transfer learning and its use in generating novel biological insights will be explored during the research project.",

Nevertheless, although sample sizes have tremendously increased in the last decade, a similar increase can be observed in the complexity of the predictions we intend to make. With the advent of generative AI, where predictions are characterized by an unprecedented degree of structure and complexity, representing and quantifying uncertainty becomes a serious challenge.

An integrated approach where the microbial community is monitored and manipulated has been suggested as a promising solution. Although some studies have addressed this issue, in depth knowledge on how the microbial community is influencing the invasion potential of opportunistic bacterial pathogens and in which way the community should be steered to avoid invasion are lacking.

We will focus on the diversity of the community, while taking into account the typical environmental conditions of aquaculture systems and the opportunities that this provides to opportunistic pathogens.

However, the main bottleneck toward unlocking the full potential of BioS is the fact that all BioS development is currently fully dependent on and limited to only those biological mechanisms for which all BioS Building Blocks are fully identified and characterized. With this project, I want to expand my BioS research path and combine innovative engineering strategies with computational learning techniques to create new-to-nature BioS Building Blocks and greatly expand the portfolio of available BioS for any molecule of interest.",

There are indications that ancestral enzymes used to be more promiscuous and more mutationally flexible, and therefore, they may hold great biotechnological appeal. Sadly, not much is currently known about which ancestral states are useful and how they can be applied for designing interesting novel biocatalysts.\n\nThis project aims to answer those questions by reviving various ancient enzymes from a functionally diverse family of glycoside phosphorylases. Furthermore, alternative combinations of mutational scenarios will be made in order to explore a large range of possibilities from which natural evolution sampled merely a few options. Machine learning techniques will be used to guide the navigation of the entire historical sequence space, allowing us to predict enzyme variants that are better starting points for enzyme engineering, or that possess more beneficial traits as such.",

An answer can be found in the domain of machine learning where a solution is learned instead of programmed. In particular, the use of deep reinforcement learning has recently solved very complex problems such as winning Atari games and controlling a robotic arm without prior knowledge and using visual feedback only.

In addition, we want to help them to make the links with new technologies explicit: e.g. opportunities and limitations of artificial intelligence, the promotion of digital skills and media literacy, links with current scientific research, placing the project within a broader social context ... In this way, the InnoVET projects get a clear added value towards the teachers and the pupils so that the efforts of the development work can realize their maximum return. This will not only be evident in the learning material, but also in the new development skills of the teachers, which will enable them to start new high quality InnoVET projects in the future. In order to achieve this, we will assist the projects by applying the COOL development methodology and the iSTEM didactics. For the projects where a close connection is possible, we will participate in the full co-creation process.",

                "project_Description": "The aim for this research project is to equip social robots with nonverbal behaviour similar to the nonverbal behaviour used by people. Nonverbal behaviour refers to the use of gestures, body language and facial expressions which we use when interacting with others. Nonverbal behaviour is said to make up 55% of our communication, and when it is lacking, wrong or ill-timed it can seriously hinder communication. Social robots are robots that interact with us using the same communication channels as people use. As such they also need to express appropriate nonverbal behaviour. If a robot\u2019s nonverbal behaviour is optimised, we expect the interaction between people and robots not only to be more pleasant, but also to be more effective. In this project, instead of programming nonverbal behaviour, we let the robot learn its nonverbal behaviour by letting it watch people talk and interact. As nonverbal behaviour is coordinated with verbal behaviour, we will learn the relationship between both by using state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks. To teach the robot, we show it video clips of people talking at TEDx events and of people engaged in a conversation, for which we work together with the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. Once the networks are trained, we will assess the performance of the robot by running a series of studies in which we measure how effective the robot is at getting a message across and how persuasive the robot is.",

It continuously receives massive streams of sequential data from our\n\n\n\nhearing, vision, touch and other senses. Nevertheless, it is capable to quickly process and learn\n\n\n\nfrom these huge amounts of data, because it can efficiently abstract it into a more compact\n\n\n\nrepresentation and because it optimally exploits the correlations that exist between information\n\n\n\nfrom its different senses. It is also very adaptive: the brain dynamically rewires itself all the time\n\n\n\nand can learn to cope with sudden and lasting changes.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, artificial neural networks still cannot match the brain its performance when dealing\n\n\n\nwith multi-sensory information. Current approaches typically focus on specific combinations of\n\n\n\nsensors and do not offer a generally applicable solution. They process the different sensor streams\n\n\n\nin separation and only combine them at the highest levels of abstraction, while the human brain\n\n\n\nappears to search for correlations already in early processing stages. Also, other recent\n\n\n\nobservations in the field of neuroscience involving dynamic adaptation remain unexplored for\n\n\n\napplications in neural networks.\n\n\n\nIn my research, I will therefore draw inspiration from these insights to create a generic deep\n\n\n\narchitecture that can efficiently integrate information streams from multiple and noisy sensors,\n\n\n\nwhile being able to adapt to changes in the sensor or the environment.",
