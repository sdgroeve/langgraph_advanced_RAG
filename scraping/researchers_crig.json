More recently we became strongly interested in mechanisms of cellular plasticity. As such we developed interest in EMT, which currently focuses on the in vivo function of EMT-related transcription factors during inflammation driven cancer.We use in vivo EMT models for melanoma, skin, ovarian and breast cancer, immunity and inflammation research and functional genomic techniques, single cell analysis, reversed genetic screenings to uncover gene-expression profiles, epigenetic changes and various signaling pathways that modulate EMT in immune and cancer cells",

We study molecular signaling mechanisms (e.g. NF-kB signaling) in cancer cells and immune cells, which eventually contribute to the regulation of tumor cell proliferation and survival. In this context, we have identified the protease MALT1 as a novel therapeutic target, which directly (by mediating cancer cell proliferation) and indirectly (by mediating regulatory T cell expansion) contributes to cancer. We are also studying several cytokines (e.g. IL-33) and cytokine receptors that regulate innate and adaptive immune cells (e.g. regulatory T cells) in the tumor microenvironment. Finally, we are strongly interested in the molecular links between intestinal inflammation, intestinal motility, chronic constipation, microbial dysbiosis and colorectal cancer (subteamI. Afonina) as well as in the biological activity of certain secondary metabolites (subteamJ. Staal). In our research we make use of several cellular models for preclinical evaluation of cancer drugs, as well as the mouse as an in vivo model to study cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Our technical approaches include several signaling assays, proteomics (focusing on protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination), immunophenotyping, Treg expansion, mouse genetic engineering and mouse models of disease (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, IBD, psoriasis, MS).",

Since their identification in 1994 en 1995, large improvements in the technologies allowed the identification of deleterious mutations in millions of breast cancer patients. Our research team strongly contributed to insights in the mutation spectrum and frequency in Belgian patients.Through translational research our team aims to contribute to the improvement of the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hereditary breast cancer by extensive molecular characterization of germline and somatic mutations. Besides the study of mutations/variants in the coding regions, research projects are ongoing to determine the role of variants in non-coding and regulatory regions. Furthermore, we have a major interest in the development of in vitro and in vivo functional tests to determine the clinical significance of genetic variants.Besides hereditary breast cancer, our team also performs case-related research in the context of other familial cancer syndromes (hereditary colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc.)"

        "research_focus": "Food contamination by microorganisms can occur at various stages, including cultivation, harvest, storage, processing, and distribution. In specific conditions, certain fungi that contaminate crops can produce harmful substances, such as mycotoxins. Various types of mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, trichothecenes, and fumonisins, can be produced by a range of fungi. These contaminated crops are consumed directly or indirectly through animal products like meat and milk from animals raised on contaminated feed. Mycotoxins can have a wide range of adverse effects on human health, including potential carcinogenicity or DNA damage, and targeting specific organs like the liver, kidney, or intestines.While the health effects of certain specific mycotoxins have been studied, the impact of long-term consumption of multiple mycotoxins has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, the HUMYCO project, which is funded by the European Research Council (ERC), aims to assess the risk of conditions such as hepatocellular, colorectal, and renal cancer resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of multiple mycotoxins. The study will involve large cohorts in Europe and Africa, encompassing approximately half a million participants from ten European countries, including the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study cohort that commenced in 1992. Researchers will evaluate participants' mycotoxin exposure through dietary questionnaires and the analysis of blood, urine, and feces samples collected at the beginning of the EPIC study. Cohort studies from sub-Saharan Africa, The Netherlands and other are currently in process. In addition, the study will utilize data on mycotoxin levels in foods obtained from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and its member states. To identify mycotoxins associated with cancer risk, dietary intake among cancer cases and biomarker levels in collected biological samples will be compared to those of non-cancer cases. Finally, the study will seek to identify mutations in the genome induced by mycotoxins in both mice and human cells.Next to that, Prof. De Boevre is coordinator of GLORIA \u2013 GEZONDHEIDSMONITOR (Ghent Longitudinal Observational Research Investigating Aging). Aging is a significant challenge in the 21st century, affecting various aspects of society and healthcare systems. A study shows that most people over 45 develop complex diseases, but avoiding smoking, high blood pressure, and obesity can reduce disease severity. GLORIA \u2013 GEZONDHEIDSMONITOR will therefore facilitate the follow-up of 20.000 Ghentians in the upcoming 20 years in terms of holistic questionnaires, physical tests and biosampling. The GLORIA \u2013 GEZONDHEIDSMONITOR project aims to support research on healthy aging by providing quick access to samples and data (biobank), understanding genetic and lifestyle factors in health, and developing new treatments and tests for better healthcare.

These steroidal hormones trigger apoptosis of the malignant cells by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily.Long term glucocorticoid treatment is limited by two major problems:glucocorticoid-related side effects, which hampers patient quality of life, andthe onset of glucocorticoid resistance, which is a gradual process that is inevitable in many patients.This emphasizes the need to re-evaluate and optimize the widespread use of glucocorticoids in lymphoid malignancies.To achieve these goals, a deep understanding of the mechanisms governing glucocorticoid responsiveness is required. In addition, no clinical test to determine the glucocorticoid responsiveness of patients in an early stage is in place. Hence, glucocorticoid-resistant patients continue to receive extended glucocorticoid treatment, and thus needlessly carry the burden of the glucocorticoid-related side effects.To resolve this unmet clinical need, we aim to find a set of biomarkers that can be used to determine the onset of glucocorticoid resistance in these patients. Such a diagnostic test would enable faster reorientation of the patients' treatment protocol and would improve the patient\u2019s quality of life.With the latter goal in mind, we recently broadened our scope from sole GR research to a specific focus on specific cross-talk mechanisms involving also other nuclear receptors. As such, we hope to capitalize on a novel topic towards potential therapeutic innovation with high relevance in cancer.",

This work was driven by the application of various bioinformatics tools exploring transcriptomic data from primary neuroblastoma samples. This resulted in the identification and dissection of oncogenic pathways (including ALK and FOXM1 pathway) to pinpoint new vulnerable nodes for therapy (ref 1 and 2) and the establishment of m(i)RNA expression signatures for a more accurate prognosis. At the genomics level, we succeeded in the identification of prognostic DNA copy number alterations for high-risk neuroblastoma by an extensive international collaborative study (ref 3).The past years our research focus has shifted from neuroblastoma to a broad spectrum of cancer entities, including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, prostate cancer, various pediatric cancers as well as CUPs (cancers of unknown primary). Moreover, we embarked on the processing ofliquid biopsiessuch as blood plasma for the analysis and interpretation of genomic biomarkers. In this context, we also focus on the development of dedicated data mining pipelines that should accompany these new analytical tools and which are necessary to fully exploit the clinical application for the cancer patient. For instance, we established a new analytical and bioinformatics pipeline to identify the copy number profile for prognosis based on cfDNA (circulating cell-free DNA) isolated from blood plasma (ref 4). In addition, we developed a method that measures the DNA methylation profile of cfDNA and that aids in diagnosis of both pediatric and adult cancers (ref 5 and 6). At the moment, we are investigating the potential of circulating RNA and DNA from blood cells as marker for drugs sensitivity including immunotherapy. To allow the interpretation of bulk omics data of complex mixtures (such as in blood), we have built ample expertise incomputational deconvolution of bulk omics datawhich is an emerging new area in bioinformatics. This computational method allows to dissolve data from a complex mixture in its individual components and is also highly relevant in the context of tumor heterogeneity (ref 7 and 8). \u00a0Since recently, we embarked on the analysis of tumor heterogeneity using alsosingle-cell omicstools.In summary, our team has expertise in (single-cell) genomics, bioinformatics and (liquid biopsy) biomarker research for pediatric and adult cancers. Importantly, our research is positioned at the interface between technological/bioinformatic development and clinical validation/implementation.",

There are corresponding diagnostic and treatment options available for dogs and humans, while the progression of cancer in dogs is fast enough to obtain results within a reasonable period of time. Lastly, pet dogs have a broader access to clinical trials than humans, enabling extensive research opportunities."

        "research_focus": "Foods may be contaminated by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) during cultivation, harvest, storage, processing, distribution, or preparation. Under certain conditions, some fungi that contaminate crops may produce toxic components, such as mycotoxins. Many different classes of mycotoxins (aflatoxins, trichothecenes, fumonisins, etc.) may be produced by a range of fungi. Contaminated crops may be consumed directly, or indirectly, through animal products (meat, milk, etc.) raised on contaminated feed.Mycotoxins can cause a wide range of toxic effects in humans, from reportedly inducing carcinogenesis or DNA damage, to targeting specific organs, like the kidney, liver, or intestines. Although the health effects of some specific mycotoxins are already well investigated (like aflatoxins), the effect of chronically consuming multiple mycotoxins has not been researched. Therefore, the research line \u201cmycotoxins and human health\u201d aims to investigate health effects, particularly cancer risk, due to long-term consumption of multiple mycotoxins.The research studies \u2013 in close collaboration with the World Health Organization \u2013 International Agency for Research on Cancer (WHO-IARC) will use one of the largest cohorts in Europe, including half a million subjects from ten countries, namely The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study cohort. Participants\u2019 dietary mycotoxin exposure will be investigated via dietary questionnaires and blood samples, collected at baseline of the EPIC study, which started in 1992, and using multi-mycotoxin levels in foods obtained via EFSA and its member states. Intakes among cancer cases will be compared against non-cancer cases, with a main focus on colorectal, kidney, and hepatocellular cancers. These analyses should tell us more about the relationship between intake of multiple mycotoxins and cancer risk. Moreover, through collaborations in Malawi, dietary exposure to multi-mycotoxins as a predisposing factor for oesophageal and hepatocellular cancer is being investigated.",

Peptides are also involved in cancer, and as such, they can be used as biomarkers but also as theranostics. Two examples from our group highlight the role of peptides in cancer:quorum sensing peptides, produced by micro-organisms including our microbiome, have been demonstrated i.a. to promote metastasis. Hence, this group of bacterial molecules is also an explanatory factor in the host-microbiome interaction (e.g .CRC, breast and oral cancers)Cryptic peptides, derived from proteins (eg human growth hormone), can be used as novel lead molecules to target cancer cells (e.g. melanoma).Next to our interest in peptides, we are experienced in establishing quality specifications and analytics of investigational and marketed medicines used in oncology, e.g. asparaginase.Of note, our team is also involved in the European Commission selected Sustainable Drug Discovery (S-DISCO) consortium, and is a GMP (EU recognized) laboratory for quality evaluation of medicines.Finally, we have experience in ADME in rodents (incl.

BioMMedA is part of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology (IBiTech) at UGent. The scope of its research ranges from simulations at the molecular scale to study membranes, (glyco)proteins, and ligands to the study of flow and transport processes of blood and biological fluids in various organ systems (cardiovascular, brain, liver, kidney, lymphatics) in humans and animals models (zebrafish, mouse, large mammals) and artificial organs, as well as biomechanical aspects of organ systems and medical devices. Hereby, research at BioMMedA often starts from clinically relevant questions in order to support and valorize a better understanding and diagnosis of pathophysiological problems, patient-specific treatment planning, and the design of medical devices.Within BioMMedA, prof. Debbaut focuses on the use of computational biomechanics as a tool for personalized medicine in two main research areas: cancer and minimally invasive procedures. The cancer-related research includes topics on locoregional drug delivery to study the mass transport of drugs, e.g. in order to optimize and personalize transarterial therapies for liver cancer and intraperitoneal chemotherapy for peritoneal carcinomatosis. Also the mass transport in the lymphatic system is being investigated in order to better understand and treat lymphedema (potential side effect of breast cancer surgery and radiation therapy). Other topics include the biophysics of tumorous tissues and the development of planning tools in support of minimally invasive interventions, such as robot-assisted partial nephrectomy procedures for kidney cancer and catheter-guided interventions in the brain.",

It\u2019s an inflammation related cancer which generally develops in a background of chronic liver disease, characterized by continuous immune cell infiltration and release of pro-inflammatory mediators which are involved in malignant transformation. Macrophages dominate the chronic inflammatory microenvironment and aid in the transition of chronic inflammation to neoplastic transformation by the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. In addition, specific tumor-associated macrophages play a key role in tumor progression through the production of cytokines and growth factors involved in tumor growth, metastasis and invasion. One of our research topics include unraveling the contribution of different liver macrophage subsets to tumor initiation and growth and further investigating how we can target those specific macrophage subsets to enhance anti-tumor immunity and/or suppress tumor tolerance by using in vitro and in vivo models as well as human samples.A major hurdle in cancer research, and biomedical research in general, is translation of results to the clinic. The most commonly used HCC models fail to represent the complex tumor microenvironment, are time consuming and do not allow timely and effective therapy evaluation. Therefore, our focus is set on developing human-based models including relevant orthotopic humanized mouse models and human sample based in vitro/ex vivo systems, essential for future immune-oncology studies and (immuno)therapy evaluation, as a leap forward to precision medicine."

Moreover, I pursue to exploit the unique setting of the new GE31 department to integrate proteomics more to forefront, assemble the power of multiple model systems guided by the expertise of (inter)national teams, strive for clinically relevant objectives and aim for research findings that can also be translated to (related) other cancer entities such as medulloblastoma. Given my strong interest to further explore novel options for a precision medicine approach for pediatric cancer patients, I aim to actively seek opportunities to combine targeted drugging options with immunomodulators and reorient towards novel therapeutic strategies such as targeted protein degradation with the design of a new generation of cancer drugs (e.g. PROTACs and molecular glues).",

In addition to cytokine-mediated anti-tumor action, such as the activation of other cytotoxic lymphocytes through IFN-\u03b3 production, iNKT cells can exert direct cytotoxicity against tumor cells. \u00a0Clinical applicability of glycolipid analogues such as \u03b1-GalCer is limited because they induce iNKT cell hyporesponsiveness and a 'mixed' cytokine species with potentially conflicting functionality in tumor rejection. \u00a0We developed novel \u03b1-GalCer analogues with a marked Th1 bias (i.e. leading to preferential IFN-\u03b3 production) in both mice and men, leading to superior protection against the establishment of long tumor nodules in vivo.We were also able to demonstrate the importance of iNKT cell activity in multiple myeloma (MM). MM is a B-cell malignancy hallmarked by uncontrolled accumulation of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM) \u00a0which remains mostly incurable. \u00a0We were able to show a significantly decreased number of iNKT cells in the blood of MM patients. Moreover, these cells were found to be functionally impaired, showing a greatly reduced potential to produce IFN-\u03b3. Despite the functional impairment, treatment of 5T33MM mice with \u03b1-GalCer-pulsed DCs still managed to prolong survival times.Human MM patients were shown to have elevated leptin serum levels. Moreover, leptin receptor expression was strongly increased on \u00a0iNKT cells. We demonstrated that leptin receptor blocking could significantly improve the anti-tumoral effect of \u03b1-GalCer stimulation by overcoming iNKT cell hyporesponsiveness, revealing the potential for \u00a0a novel method for checkpoint inhibition in iNKT cell immunotherapy.",

Despite the myriad of technologies already available to address interactions between proteins, there are still some important limitations. We try to push this so-called interactomics field forward by creating technologies that eliminate the shortcomings from existing technologies. Our Virotrap platform aims at capturing the intracellular protein complex in virus-like particles that are budded from the cells. This eliminates the need for lysis of the host cells, a common and drastic step that affects protein complex integrity. To enable research of endogenous protein complexes, we use genome engineering technology (mainly CRISPR-Cas9) to introduce epitope tags or functional enzymatic activities on the proteins of interest.\u00a0For example, endogenous implementation of proximal biotinylation (a method called bioID) on key cancer proteins (i.e. p53) and their mutants using advanced experimental designs now enables us to comprehensively map the complete protein complex in a single experiment.Combined, these technologies will allow us to get a high resolution and high confidence view on protein complexes in the cell, both in normal and disease conditions. Such information is essential to design drugs that interfere with the pathways affected in disease. In fact, we have invested in technology variants that allow cancer drug profiling and we are now also generating advanced in vitro model systems to study protein complexes in cancer, aiding drug discovery and drug development efforts. We collaborate with several groups within and outside CRIG on several questions related to different cancers. We also collaborate with other groups in CRIG on general proteomics technologies, biomarker discovery and extracellular vesicle biology.",

Camelidae nanobodies offer several advantages over conventional antibodies. They are 10 times times smaller but have similar specificity and binding affinities as conventional antibodies. Nanobodies are coded by a single exon, and thus can be amplified by PCR and expressed in large amounts in various hosts. They can also be used as excellent tools in the structural and functional characterization of their target antigens. Thus, the nanobody lab has developed extensive expertise in knocking out verifiable functions of proteins in cells using nanobodies. One can i.e. \u201cknockout\u201d specific protein domains or protein-protein interactions, while the antigen is still being expressed in the cell. In this way, nanobodies can serve two purposes; they can be used as new research tools to study protein function in vitro and in living cells, and they offer potential for the development of novel therapeutic applications.Using nanobody technology, we have focused on the study of proteins that regulate cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis, with an emphasis on the actin cytoskeleton. Our specific contributions to the field are that we have been able to demonstrate that nanobodies act as high-affinity antagonists of protein function in the cytoplasm of cells, without the need to alter protein expression, and we have succeeded in triggering protein loss-of-function by intracellular redistribution of endogenous proteins to different subcellular loci. Our lab uses a comprehensive approach, in which biochemistry, protein chemistry, cell biology and molecular biology are blended and integrated.",

We focus our proteome studies on the analysis of several protein modifications such as protein phosphorylation by kinases, protein ubiquitination and protein processing by proteases. In addition, we are particularly interested in N-terminal proteoforms that result from different usage of translation initiation codons amongst others. We use high-end mass spectrometers for identifying proteins with deregulated levels among different proteomes, allowing us to spot potential protein biomarkers. Classical and novel affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approaches are used to map the composition of protein complexes in which most, if not all, proteins reside and exert their functions. We are particularly interested in protein biogenesis and combine ribo-seq data with positional proteomics data to map different N-terminal proteoforms and try to understand their functions. More recently, we implemented thermal proteome profiling proteomics for identifying the targets (and off-targets) of small molecule drugs and started clinical proteome studies in which we focus on disease-specific protein markers.",

Defining their mode of action will result in 1) improved, specific cancer therapies causing less side-effects and 2) lead to the identification of specific biomarkers necessary for patient stratification and patient tailored medicine. Both, specific drugs and biomarkers will allow personalized medicine, treating smaller groups of patients with highly specific drugs targeting aggressive subtypes of cancers.The availability of reliable in vitro and in vivo models is essential for the identification of new compounds/biomarkers, to validate them, and to pave the way to pre-clinical testing of putative novel therapeutic strategies. Especially in the case of rare malignancies, this is the main hurdle to overcome. The main goal of our research is to perform top-level \u2018bench-to-bedside\u2019 translational research. Starting from a clinical need and patient samples, we\u00a0 create, using a strong expertise in generating genetic models, reliable in vitro (e.g. by mimicking genetic aberrations in established cell lines, generate patient-derived primary cultures like induced pluripotent stem cells) and in vivo models (patient-derived xenografts, mimicking genetic aberrations in laboratory animals). These models allow us to identify novel tumor suppressors and oncogenes, define their mode of action, identify up/downstream drugable nodes and potential prognostic biomarkers using state-of-the-art genomics and proteomics, validate them and eventually screen for compounds that can perturb their oncogenic functions.",

We invest heavily in technologies:spatial multi-omics,AI-driven spatial analysis,epigenetics,in vivo CRISPR screens.Our liver cell atlas work revealed the modular architecture of the liver sinusoids, which are constituted of hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), stellate cells and Kupffer cells (KCs). We found that each KC projects an important part of its body across the LSEC barrier to be in close contact with a stellate cell and a hepatocyte, generating a four-cell-circuit. The genetic program of these four cells is completely integrated, with each cell representing an essential part of the cellular niche of the other cells. This suggests that throughout evolution hepatocytes, LSECs, stellate cells and KCs have become genetically integrated to function together as an interconnected functional sinusoidal module. This modular view forms the basis of our research where we aim tounravel the cell-cell interactions forming the blueprint of the homeostatic sinusoidal liver module,unravel the signals driving multiplication of liver modules during neonatal liver growth and upon regeneration,understand how metastatic cells hijack the liver building blocks to build their own modules.The objective of our liver metastasis research is to study the crosstalk between the liver metastasis macrophages and the cells constituting their niche, including cancer cells, mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells. Our project involves human and murine liver samples. We hypothesize that the cancer cells rewire cell-cell circuits within the macrophage niche to manipulate macrophage activity and promote tumor expansion. The goal of our research is to understand the cell-cell interactions within the metastatic macrophage niches so well that we can rewire these regulatory circuits to block the tumor growth.",

During injury, fast repair mechanisms are critical to maintain the skin\u2019s barrier function and we study how epidermal stem cells communicate with fibroblasts and immune cells to orchestrate inflammation and subsequent tissue regeneration. However, wound repair can predispose tissues to cancer initiation and we aim to identify novel molecular mechanisms through which inflammation, cell death and fibrosis modulate epidermal stem cells and impact on skin regeneration and neoplasia.To dissect how intercellular crosstalk in the skin orchestrates inflammation, injury repair and/or tumour initiation, we are addressing four key questions:What are the molecules that are released during cutaneous injury repair and how do they modulate regenerative and neoplastic responses?Which molecular pathways control the activation of epidermal stem cells?How do different modalities of keratinocyte cell death influence the skin\u2019s tissue response?Can we manipulate molecular signaling pathways in the skin to improve tissue regeneration, while preventing tumour initiation?",

This is of particular matter in the head and neck where ablative surgery results in both esthetic and functional morbidity. Intra-operative imaging techniques can assist the surgeon in order to achieve oncological sound margins while minimizing morbidity.-\u00a0Tumor micro-environment: Tumor profiling and characterization is a necessary tool in order to individualize treatment, and more adequately predict outcome after treatment. Insight into the more detailed mechanisms of tumor aggressiveness will provide us with these data, which ultimately will define the treatment.-\u00a0PSMA beyond the prostate: exploring prostate-specific membrane antigen as a target in the treatment of late-stage malignancies of the thyroid, liver and the head and neck: Patients with head and neck cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma or iodine refractory thyroid cancer have a poor prognosis, with a respective 5y overall survival of approximately 50%, 15% and 20 %. Patients can be confronted with severe complaints caused by therapy resulting in a detrimental impact on the quality of life. Moreover, adjuvant therapies are often insufficient to achieve cure or long-term remission when a patient is diagnosed with metastatic disease. There is thus a great need for new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to improve these patients' survival and quality of life. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is heavily expressed on the membrane of most prostate cancers. Besides enabling improved imaging of prostate cancers using PET/CT, PSMA is used as a novel therapeutic target and targeting PSMA using the therapeutic radionuclide 177Lu has shown to increase survival in patients with metastatic prostatic cancers. However, the protein\u2019s name was wrongly chosen, as PSMA is also expressed in the tumor-induced neovasculature of solid cancers. Significantly, PSMA expression in these solid cancers was associated with a worse prognosis. Consequentially, immunohistochemical demonstration of PSMA expression by the tumor and PSMA-directed imaging using PET/CT might enable a distinction between patients with high- and low-risk disease. We hypothesize that the destruction of these blood vessels with 177Lu-PSMA might increase survivalin these patients. Furthermore, because of the increased necrosis, PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy might also increase the impact of other systemic therapies such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In conclusion, results from this project could enable a more individualized tumor-specific therapy with better survival for the patient.",

We have developed a new immunotherapeutic treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aggressive blood cancer. We generate, starting from hematopoietic stem cells from the patient, immune cells (T-cells) directed against a protein (tumor antigen) on the cell surface of the AML cells. For these T-cells to recognize, attack and kill the cancer cells, it is crucial that the tumor antigen is highly expressed on the AML cells, but has a low or absent expression on vital organs, and is preferentially overexpressed on the leukemic stem cell that generally escapes chemotherapy. We have already succeeded in generating mature T-cells directed against an AML tumor antigen, from hematopoietic stem cells from clinically applicable stem cell sources such as cord blood and mobilized peripheral blood. We are now evaluating the function of these T cells in an AML mouse model.The first target is acute myeloid leukemia, but this is a treatment that can be expanded to other malignancies (both hematological and solid).Together with the research groups of Jan Philipp\u00e9 andYvan Saeys, we are trying to unravel the immunophenotype and mRNA characteristics of leukaemia stem cells and blasts in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), using multicolour flow cytometry and bio-informatics.Informing patients about their disease and possible treatments is crucial in shared decision making. Immunotherapy is a novel cancer treatment, which is very complex to explain in layman\u2019s terms. For this, we have developedImmuno-T, a motion comicexplaining the genesis of cancer and the working mechanisms of three types of immunotherapy. We are now starting with a phase II study is to assess the efficacy of this virtual aid in discussions about immunotherapy between care providers, patients and family relatives in view of improving health literacy and informed decision making.The effect of bibliotherapy has been shown in various settings. We are now conducting a trial in which we investigate the impact of 1-on-1 reading sessions by health care students to cancer patients, both on the well-being and empowerment of the patients and on the professional development of the students.",

In addition, we employ high- end flow sorting and single-cell transcriptomics. Therapeutic asparaginase-monitoring is performed using spectrophotometry, with a quality assurance system in place. In addition, biobanking within national and international clinical trials is a core activity.Importantly, the optimal translation of the fundamental and applied research into children benefit (short-and long-term) is a major aspect throughout all our research lines",

From that angle, I have developed a track record in health services research in radiation oncology, mainly focused on access to care, quality issues in radiation oncology, cost-accounting, health economics and health technology assessment. Convinced that the benefit to the patient should be central - not only in our clinical practice but also in our research - quality of life evaluation and patient reported outcomes are also important research topics, as well as value-based health care, where the outcome that matters to patients is core.Collaborating with and within various international organizations - such as the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), the European Cancer Organisation (E.C.O.), the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Collaboration for Cancer Outcomes, Research and Evaluation (CCORE); and in Belgium with the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre (KCE) and the Belgian Cancer Registry, has given me the opportunity to develop the above-sited interests not only at the Belgian and European level, but also in a global perspective.I am convinced that a continuum from basic research over clinical and translational research into implementation and health services research is key to advance the outcome of our cancer patients. The latter are crucial to support the adoption of innovative radiotherapy interventions in our health system, which is not evident in the context of often-limited health care budgets.",

The majority was referred to as \u2018junk DNA\u2019 with no obvious function throughout life. Today, there\u2019s ample evidence demonstrating that the majority of the genome is producing non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts that can have important functions in every aspect of cell biology. My lab focuses on the study of long non-coding RNAs in cancer with the goal to expand our knowledge on lncRNA functions, gain insights in the mechanisms by which they operate and evaluate their use as therapeutic targets and cancer biomarkers. One of the most intriguing aspects of lncRNAs is their exquisite expression specificity. Through elaborate PAN-cancer omics analyses, we prioritize cancer type-specific lncRNAs as potential targets for therapy and study how they mechanistically affect cancer hallmarks in various cancer model systems. Cancer type-specific lncRNAs are not only attractive targets for therapy, they also qualify as potential biomarkers for diagnosis or treatment response monitoring. By applying state-of-the art RNA-sequencing technology, we evaluate the biomarker potential of these lncRNAs in liquid biopsies from cancer patients. To support this research, we continuously invest in the development of novel technologies (both wet- and dry-lab) and data analysis methods.",

For this purpose several wild type strains as well as genetically modified (e.g. NF-kB reporter) mice are used and 4T1-luc cells are typically inoculated although Py230 cells are an alternative option. This preclinical model is also an elegant screening tool for novel candidate therapeutic molecules such as c-Met inhibitors in comparison to classical chemotherapy (cisplatin). In this context tumor-associated macrophages and neutrophils as key innate immune cells are typically analysed and cytokine profiling as well as IVIS are performed. Complementing this inflammatory profile, chitinase 3-like 1 and lipocalin-2 are evaluated as a novel innate immunity related protein biomarkers for inflammation and metastasis.The Laboratory of Biochemistry has developed an extensive set of more than 150 standard operation procedures (e.g. for immunohistochemistry, 3-laser flowcytometry, multiplex, cell culture, western blotting, ELISA) to analyze a variety of biological samples such as serum, mammary tumor, lymph node, spleen, lung tissue, and cell culture supernatant obtained from in vivo and in vitro experimental studies.",

Unfortunately, frontline radiation and chemotherapy causes lasting cognitive problems and can also lead to secondary cancers. Additionally, about one-fourth of children and 50% of adults with acute leukemia develop resistance to therapy or relapse post therapy.Mechanisms of resistance are poorly understood and current research on oncogenesis (the development of cancer) mainly focuses on alterations (\u201cmutations\u201d) of gene units in leukemia. Recent studies show that aberrant patterns of transcripts - pieces of RNA stitched together via a process called \u201csplicing\u201d - are critical factors in oncogenesis.We have discovered that proteins controlling transcript stitching are aberrantly stabilized and have identified that this leads to abnormal splicing patterns. This phenomenon creates generations of transcripts not found in normal cells, ultimately leading to resistance to therapy. We aim to define mechanisms of therapy resistance related to transcript stitching and protein stability in high-risk leukemia by directly comparing therapy-responsive or resistant leukemia cases to each other and to healthy samples. We will also suggest therapeutic platforms for patients using relevant models of disease that can translate to clinical trials. This approach is at the heart of personalized medicine, as it takes into consideration protein levels for candidate proteins to target drug resistance.",

        "research_focus": "The therapeutic value of nucleic acid therapeutics for cancer therapy has long been recognized. Nucleic acid drugs generally require delivery into the cytosol of cells to be functional. Unfortunately, the cell membrane is impermeable for hydrophilic macromolecules and cellular delivery is typically facilitated by loading them into nanoparticles. Such particles gain access to cells via endocytosis. However, drug release from endocytic organelles remains a rare event and the internalized carrier and cargo are mainly trafficked toward lysosomes for degradation.A major aim in our research is therefore to develop innovative nanoparticle-oriented strategies to stimulate cytosolic delivery of nucleic acids (siRNA/mRNA/pDNA), e.g. in cancer-related cell types, both for ex vivo and in vivo applications. To reach this goal, we focus on (1) improving nanoparticle design, (2) repurposing small molecules as delivery-promoting adjuvants and (3) exploiting endogenous materials for nucleic acid delivery (e.g. endogenous lipids and proteins). Importantly, in these projects we aim to fundamentally understand the biological pathways that affect nucleic acid drug delivery in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo to guide the rational design of next generation nanoformulations with optimized intracellular drug delivery properties.Examples of currently ongoing projects include the optimization, characterization and application of nanotechnologies (including lipid nanoparticles or LNPs) for ex vivo/in vivo cell engineering in adoptive cell therapy (e.g. CAR-T cell engineering) as well as drug combination therapy through concurrent application of small molecules and nucleic acid drugs in a single nanoparticle design (e.g. chemoimmunotherapy).",

Attachment of free-flowing cancer cells to the mesothelial layer of the peritoneal membrane results in the formation of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). We aim to explore the use of nanomedicines (100 \u2013 200 nm in size) carrying chemotherapeutics (paclitaxel, cisplatin, oxaliplatin) and/or nucleic acids (siRNA, mRNA, pDNA) to treat peritoneal carcinomatosis.Major aims are toprolong the residence time of nanomedicines in the peritoneal cavityspecifically target tumor cellsinvestigate stability of nanomedicines in peritoneal fluidsenhance tumor penetration of nanomedicinesOur laboratory developed fluorescence microscopy based techniques (Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy and Single Particle Tracking) that are ideally suited to explore the stability of nanomedicines in biofluids such as peritoneal fluid and blood. This enables us to determine the most optimal physicochemical properties (size, charge and composition) of the nanomedicines to increase the intraperitoneal residence time and prolong the time frame in which peritoneal metastases can be treated by the nanoparticle formulations.Furthermore, the feasibility of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) to deliver nanomedicine and controlled release formulations (such as hydrogels) to the peritoneal cavity is explored. PIPAC is a novel technique to deliver drugs into the abdominal cavity as an aerosol under high pressure. It is hypothesized to have advantages such as enhancing tissue uptake, distributing drugs homogeneously within the closed and expanded abdominal cavity and higher local concentration of drugs in the peritoneal cavity.Research is conducted in close collaboration withprof. Wim Ceelenand prof. Wouter Willaert from the Ghent University Hospital."

Also the targeted delivery of cancer drugs to tumors using tumor homing cells is a topic within our group. Many of our therapeutic agents are therapeutic DNA or mRNA molecules, which upon administration allow patients to produce their own therapeutic proteins in their body. By engineering on/off switches in our therapeutics mRNAs, the production of these therapeutic proteins by the patient\u2019s body can be turned off/on on demand. In our work we also focus on pets with cancer. Dogs, cats and horses spontaneously develop tumors with histopathological and biological features similar to human tumors. Within our research these pets with cancer are on the one hand considered as the final goal for the development anticancer drugs, and at the other hand considered as excellent models for the development of anticancer drugs for humans. In this ways we hope to contribute to the development of new anticancer drugs for both veterinary and human patients afflicted with cancer."

These methods allow us to probe what cells are present and where exactly they are in the tissue. This can of course also shed light on which other cells the macrophage populations of interest are interacting with, which further allows us to investigate their functions as well as signals that may regulate their presence in these regions. Using an array of mouse models, we examine the consequences of lacking specific genes in these different macrophages or lacking the different macrophage populations themselves. By understanding this, we aim to be able to move one step closer to utilizing these cells for cell therapy based approaches, aiming to prevent and/or reverse tumour growth.",

We explore the role of nonmutated dependency genes with focus on genes located in region of recurrent gains or losses such as transcription factors (e.g. SOX11) and genes implicated in control of replicative stress (e.g. RRM2). A strong focus currently goes towards exploring drugging the ATR-CHK1-RRM2 axis as potential important drugging vulnerability in NB. To this end, the lab uses in vitro cellular model systems, patient derived xenografts and in vivo mouse and zebrafish modeling. Responses to novel drug combinations are evaluated through state-of-the art transcriptome, epigenome and proteome analyses including also novel spatial omics platforms.

T lymphocytes are vital cells of the immune system and comprise a particular type of blood cells that is generated from the blood forming hematopoietic stem cells. In clinical settings where hematopoietic stem cells are transplanted to rebuild the immune system, for instance following chemotherapy with the aim to eradicate cancer cells, the recovery of T lymphocytes is slow and often limited, leading to a prolonged phase of immune deficiency in which patients are highly susceptible to infections. By obtaining novel insights into the molecular network that induces the step-wise conversing of hematopoietic stem cells into T lymphocytes, we aim to improve the development of these immune cells following stem cell transplantation. In addition, since many of the key transcriptional regulators of normal T lymphocyte development are often aberrantly expressed in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, another part of our work aims to reveal how gain- or loss-of-function expression of these factors alters normal T cell development and contributes to oncogenic transformation. By studying the changes in gene expression that occur upon such perturbations, these insights provide novel opportunities for targeted therapy.",

An attractive target for cancer therapy may be offered by the p53 tumor suppressor protein, which is thought to be repressed or inactivated in virtually all human malignancies. A remarkable feature of neuroblastoma is that the p53 gene is rarely mutated. Instead, increased activity of the p53-inhibitory protein MDM2 seems to serve as a predominant mechanism for escape from p53-mediated growth control in neuroblastoma cells. Our research aims at restoring the antitumor activity of p53 in neuroblastoma by exploiting several complementary approaches.We investigate how MDM2 inhibitors could be integrated in the treatment scheme of neuroblastoma by performing preclinical combination studies of these drugs with other small molecules and chemotherapeutic agents. Treatment options for p53-mutant neuroblastoma are explored by preclinical studies of small molecules reported to rescue mutant p53 function in other cancer types.We also examine the potential value of p53-targeting microRNAs as an independent therapeutic target for neuroblastoma tumors with wild-type p53.Finally, we investigate the potential application of liquid biopsies as a tool for treatment response monitoring in pediatric cancer basket trial patients.",

Neuroblastoma is one of the most common extra-cranial tumors in childhood, characterized by a biological and clinical heterogeneity, ranging from spontaneous regression to full blown metastatic fatal disease. Neuroblastoma is a mutational silent disease while copy number alterations are frequently found and are \u00a0prognostic important. We identified gain of chromosome 17(q) as one of the most common copy number alterations and prognostic marker in neuroblastoma. During the latest years, we invested in the optimalization of the use of liquid biopsies in neuroblastoma, but also in other common pediatric malignancies and showed the feasibility of this technology as a minimally invasive tool for copy number alteration detection. Not only genetic defects but also epigenetic changes have been explored in liquid biopsies in different cancer entities with good results, not limited to pediatric cases but also including adult cancers. Recently, we initiated the launch of a sarcoma research consortium at Ghent University with the aim to gather all expertise involving sarcoma research with the goal to establish close collaborations with other cancer researchers and explore novel fundamental as well as translational entry points and biomarker discovery.",

The assays can be tailored to the biological\u00a0 question. The imaging and image processing works with unlabelled cells (established cell lines, primary cells, patient cells, cell aggregates or single cells). The data analysis gives insight in the speed and directionality of collective or single cells and how this is affected by specific treatments or drugs. Indepth statistical comparisons between tested conditions is easily possible within the analysis tool. The data management system stores metadata (experimental conditions, treament conditions, imaging conditions) and the raw quantitative data.We mainly apply this platform to determine the role of signalling pathways, of proteins or proteins complexes in cancer cell motile properties in a 2D or 3D matrix context (main focus on actin cytoskeleton machinery and regulation,\u00a0 on adhesion machinery, \u2026). In a recent project on a putative tumor suppressor, the combined testing on the platform and in mice underscored the predictive power of the obtained in vitro data.This platform may be of use for researchers with an interest to quantitatively measure the impact of the expression of their protein or treatment of interest on cell migration or invasion in a cancer cell of choice. Screens of medium throughput are feasable to monitor effects on migration or invasion kinetics.",

At diagnosis, most patients with HCC are ineligible for curative surgery and can only be offered palliative treatment. Systemic therapy with classical cytotoxic drugs yields low objective response rates without proven survival benefit. Recently, the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib demonstrated a limited survival advantage for patients with advanced HCC. Sorafenib is an oral drug which blocks PDGF-, VEGF-, c-Kit- and raf signaling, both on the tumor cell and the surrounding endothelial cells. Consequently, other drugs need to be developed and novel strategies with complementary mechanisms are required to maximize efficacy and minimize resistance to current therapy with angiogenesis inhibitors or cytotoxic drugs.Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which can be induced by intratumoral hypoxia, is present in HCC and could play an essential role in tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, we investigate the therapeutic potential of agents modulating the ER stress pathways and angiogenesis in HCC.The role of hypoxia on liver progenitor cells in primary liver cancerThe major primary liver cancers in adults are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). These tumours outgrow their vascular supply and become hypoxic. We have shown a possible link between hypoxia in the tumor environment and the differentiation of liver progenitor cells (LPC), holding great potential for therapeutic intervention. Hypoxic conditions in the HCC environment could trigger LPC to differentiate towards a cholangiocytic phenotype, which has a more aggressive phenotype."

As primary goal we strive for reduced toxicity and a rise in outcome. We have implemented new technologies such as IMRT, SBRT, VMAT in the treatment of gynaecological tumors. We introduced the use of a simultaneously integrated boost and re-introduced surgery in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. Multiple toxicity reducing trials are ongoing or being initiated focusing on radiation induced toxicity such as radiation enteritis, lymph oedema and pelvic insufficiency fractures.Results of the clinical trials concerning cervical cancer have led a more basic and translational research towards a better understanding of radiation induced cell death and its effects on the tumoral environment and the patients\u2019 immune system.

        "research_focus": "Tight barriers play a crucial role in safeguarding the brain against external threats such as toxins, infectious agents, and fluctuations in peripheral blood. These barriers are integral to the brain's homeostasis mechanism, ensuring a well-regulated microenvironment around synapses and axons within the central nervous system (CNS). Despite being relatively understudied, the choroid plexus epithelium (ChPE), which constitutes the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier, is a significant and unique single layer of epithelial cells positioned at the interface between blood and CSF. Changes in the ChPE, reflected in alterations to the CSF composition, exert profound effects on the brain, impacting disease progression. Consequently, comprehending the functionality of the blood-CSF barrier under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions holds promise for unveiling novel therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing inflammatory diseases and brain tumors. Furthermore, these barriers impede the efficient delivery of therapeutics to the brain, despite the presence of diverse transport mechanisms designed to facilitate controlled nutrient and protein passage from blood to CSF. As such, exploring ways to overcome these barriers is imperative for enhancing the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in the context of brain disorders.We currently have different research lines:Examination of key processes at the blood-CSF barrier involved in brain diseases.We aim to identify pivotal molecules and cells implicated in the detrimental processes activated at the blood-CSF barrier during inflammation. Specifically, we delve into the factors influencing barrier integrity, extracellular vesicles (exosomes), immune cell trafficking and the acute phase response.The ChP as the body-to-brain axis link.We aim to ascertain the ChP's potential role as the crucial connection in the body-to-brain axis. This stems from the unique positioning of the ChP between the bloodstream and the brain. We investigate whether peripheral inflammatory triggers, particularly within the gastrointestinal system, exert an impact on the ChP. This exploration seeks to elucidate whether such influences heighten the susceptibility to the development of neuroinflammatory diseases.The blood-CSF barrier as a therapeutic delivery route.Here, we aim to enhance our understanding of the potential avenues for delivering therapeutic agents to the CNS, thereby advancing the development of targeted treatment strategies, focusing on a.o.

        "research_focus": "The Atomic & Mass Spectrometry \u2013 A&MS research unit is specialized in the determination, speciation and isotopic analysis of (trace) elements using various forms of ICP-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).The research unit studies fundamental issues of the technique and develops novel analytical methods to address challenging problems in an interdisciplinary context. In the context of cancer-related research, the A&MS unit, e.g., develops analytical approaches to visualize the 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional distribution of elements (e.g., Pt under the form of a chemotherapeutic drug) in tissues based on the combination of laser ablation (LA) sampling and ICP-MS. LA-ICP-MS can, e.g., also be used to study the fate of Fe-containing nanoparticle drug carriers or to study the distribution of metal-tagged antibodies in a tissue sample.The A&MS unit is also pioneering in exploring the use of isotope ratios in human body fluids and tissues as a marker, e.g., for iron status or liver disease. A difference was established in the isotopic composition of Cu between tumor tissue and adjacent healthy tissue. Analytical protocols were developed for high-precision isotopic analysis of a series of essential elements (e.g., Mg, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn) using multi-collector ICP-MS. Efforts are made to unravel the factors governing the isotopic composition of selected elements in human body fluids and tissues. In the contexts described above, the A&MS unit is cooperating with several departments of the Ghent University Hospital, the Leiden University Medical Centre, the Mayo Clinic (US) and the Japanese National Center for Global Health and Medicine.The group is also developing methods for single-cell analysis whereby the concentrations of metals, metalloids and some non-metals can be quantified on a single-cell basis.",

        "research_focus": "For many conditions linked to poor gut health, personalized preventive strategies and diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive biomarkers of disease are currently lacking. It is our belief that unraveling the molecular basis by which the exposome (diet, gut microbiome, etc.) impacts the human metabolome may address this hurdle.Therefore, our research aims todevelop a true molecular high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics platform (including both polar to medium apolar metabolites, lipidomics and DNA adductomics) to discriminate the metabolic phenotypes of healthy vs. diseased individuals (human and animal studies), andunravel the impact of the exposome on host metabolome (e.g. impact of red meat consumption on digestive metabolome in relation to CRC promotion).In this context, methodologies for the most frequently reported specimens that allow exploring systemic alterations of metabolites and DNA in humans (i.e. feces, saliva, tissue, blood and urine) are available at LIMET (Vanden Bussche et al., 2015; Hemeryck et al., 2015; Van Meulebroek et al., 2017; De Paepe et al., 2018; Wijnant et al., 2020). More recently, we have also successfully optimized and implemented rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS)-based methodologies (Plekhova et al., 2021) for multiple biofluids, moving metabolomics from bench to bedside by e.g. eliminating the need for extensive sample preparation. The application of the above-mentioned methodologies for the discovery of reliable and robust biomarkers to enable early diagnosis, screening, surveillance, and primary prevention of the disease, through e.g. dietary recommendations, belongs to LIMET\u2019s current research objectives.",

        "research_focus": "The goal of the breast research team at the Dept. of Radiotherapy is improving the cost-benefit ratio of radiotherapy in breast cancer patients. Since 2008 our most important achievement was the implementation of prone whole-breast irradiation at UZ Gent. Prone, compared to supine, breast radiotherapy results in less acute toxicity, less risk of radiation-induced cardiac toxicity and of lung cancer induction. Drawbacks of prone position are the complicated setup procedure, patient discomfort and reduced precision. When lymph node irradiation is required, prone position is especially challenging. We have designed an innovative prone positioning device with the arm at the treated side alongside the body (crawl position) that provides more comfort and precision than the standard prone device.Previous research of our group has shown that a technique of deep inspiration breath hold can be used to reduce radiation dose to the heart in prone breast radiotherapy. When using this technique, patients are asked to take a deep breath and hold their breath for a short time during radiation treatment. By inhaling, the heart shifts to an anatomically more favorable position, away from the breast, thus reducing heart dose. We currently use between 3 and 6 breath holds of 12 to 18 seconds for breast-only irradiation. When the lymph nodes are included in the target volumes, the treatment is more complex and requires between 10 and 14 breath holds of 15-30 seconds. This represents a substantial physical and mental effort for all but the most able patients. Therefore, our team is also focusing on finding a technique to assist patients to maintain a long breath hold of around 2.5 minutes during radiotherapy \u00a0by using oxygen in combination with hyperventilation.Another research interest of the team is accelerated radiotherapy: fewer sessions of radiation in a shorter time span with a higher dose per fraction. Accelerated radiotherapy is \u00a0attractive both for the patient (less treatment sessions) and for the hospital (more treatment capacity and shorter waiting lists), but also has some radiobiological advantages (less toxicity and improved tumor control). We are testing an accelerated schedule in 5 fractions in all settings of breast radiotherapy (breast conserving surgery or mastectomy, with or without lymph node irradiation).",

DCs can function as sentinels and alert T-lymphocytes (the soldiers of our immune system) about the presence of danger in our body, including developing tumors.We have previously uncovered a novel way by which lung tumors corrupts the function of DCs in order to escape immune control. This involves reprogramming of the DC\u2019s micro-RNA repertoire. Micro-RNAs are small non-protein coding RNAs that can \u201cveto\u201d the translation of genes into proteins wihin a cell. Intriguingly, the micro-RNA signature of these \u201ccorrupt\u201d DCs predicts a worse outcome in lung cancer patients.We are now exploring the therapeutic potential of immunostimulatory DCs generated in vitro from patient blood. By loading these cells with mRNA prepared from the patient\u2019s own tumor, a cellular vaccine is thus obtained. Following years of pre-clinical development, and through close collaboration with the GMP Production Unit of Ghent University Hospital (prof. B. Vandekerckhove), we now have 2 DC vaccine prototypes approved by regulatory authorities for testing on human subjects. Two clinical trials in lung cancer patients are active for recruitment.In addition, we are building a unique prospective collection of blood samples from immune checkpoint-treated lung cancer patients. Combining flow-cytometry and cutting edge transcriptomic analysis (collaboration withprof. K. De Preter), we will work to uncover patterns in the systemic immuno-reactome that are associated with objective tumor response c.q. resistance to these treatments. The aim is to develop of patient-friendly, minimally-invasive test for therapeutic prediction.Through the thoracic oncology clinic we are also offering patients a wide portfolio of industry-sponsored clinical studies with the latest immunotherapy combination regimen in lung cancer."

The capacity to integrate multi-omics data, to something more than the sum of the existing data, is key to elucidating the causes of complex diseases such as neuro-inflammatory diseases and cancer. Regulatory networks are a valuable tool to map systems-wide the relationships between DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites and to understand the molecular mechanisms by which these molecules influence health and disease.Our research focuses on acquiring a functional understanding of gene regulation and signaling through multi-omics data integration and regulatory network inference. To this end, we develop and apply computational approaches involving statistics, bioinformatics and machine learning. Our ultimate goal is to use this knowledge in the development of novel preventive or therapeutic strategies for successful personal healthcare.The CBIGR team has internationally recognized expertise in systems biology and bioinformatics, at the interface between biology and informatics. In cancer research, we aim to identify novel driver genes and pathways and characterize tumors and the interaction with their environment. At single cell level, we investigate plasticity and regulatory heterogeneity as responsible factors for drug escape and therapeutic failure. Current projects focus on cancers of the nervous system such as neuroblastoma and glioblastoma. We are also embedded in a multidisciplinary consortium of the inflammatory gut-brain axis where we aim to unravel the molecular mechanisms of gut-brain communication in neuro-inflammatory disorders.",

As a result, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockouts can be generated at high frequencies. Importantly, unlike Xenopus laevis or the zebrafish, Xenopus tropicalis has a genuine diploid genome which is a unique and important feature.Using TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeting of tumor suppressor genes, we have obtained the very first genetic cancer models in Xenopus tropicalis (e.g. for retinoblastoma, glioblastoma, T-ALL, AML and desmoid tumors).We are using multiplexed gene targeting for identification of oncogenic drivers and proteins that are essential for tumor formation and hence may provide novel anchor points for therapy. In addition, we are using our aquatic tumor models for pre-clinical drug validation. Our Xenopus model is well positioned between cell culture studies and mouse cancer models. Having an aquatic model greatly simplifies issues with drug administration, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics. This should increase the effectiveness and speed for bringing new compounds to the clinic. This is important since the shift from cell culture validation to animal models is a critical bottle neck in the current Drug Discovery Pipeline.",

It harbors blood vessels, an extracellular environment and functions as an organ, which cannot be found in most in vitro models. Mainly due to the natural immunodeficiency and the easy access of a complex vascular network within the CAM, its applicability in oncology is of great interest. Not only in veterinary research, but as well in the biomedical field.The applications of CAM within veterinary oncology will be investigated by the use of (animal) patient derived xenografts and testing new chemotherapeutics.

To overcome these challenges, my research aims to engineer induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using a novel method termed photoporation, which can improve production rates and result in therapeutic cells of better quality in comparison to state-of-the-art transfection techniques. The CAR+ engineered iPSCs will then be differentiated into CAR-T cells to serve as a nearly unlimited source of allogeneic CAR-T cells.",

But sadly, cancer cuts life short for hundreds of children every year, before they\u2019ve even had a chance to make their mark.Neuroblastomais a rare type of childhood cancer that develops in nerve cells, primarily affecting young children and accounting for roughly15%of all pediatric cancer deaths. Despite advances in treatment, survival rates remain low for high-risk cases, and the disease is often resistant to several conventional and multi-modal therapies. Moreover,70%of children who survive cancer suffer long-term side effects from their treatment.Neuroblastoma tumors are immunologically cold with little infiltrating immune cells and conversion to 'hot' tumors is an unmet medical need. Interestingly, tumor DNA repair mechanisms play an important role in shaping anti-tumor immune responses, which can be triggered by CDK12 inhibition. During my PhD, I will evaluate therapeutic targeting of CDK12 in immunocompetent neuroblastoma mouse models and its impact on the tumor micro-environment using a combination ofsingle-cell spatial transcriptomicsandspatial proteomicstechnologies. This approach will enable high-resolution mapping of tumor-immune cell infiltration, cell-cell interactions and signaling pathways, offering valueable insights for guiding the development of more precise, durable treatments for neuroblastoma patients.To plan exciting futures, chase their dreams, and live a life that is full of possibilities, we wont stop until every child can live a long, happy and healthy life. In the 1960s cancer was practically a death sentence in children, today, more than eight out of 10 children survive. Together we can and we will cure every child of cancer.",

To achieve this, the combined use of electrochemical detection with light-triggered sensor technology for the specific and sensitive detection of pre-selected DNA and RNA cancer biomarkers is proposed. The application of this technology on tissue and liquid biopsy samples will be a major contribution to the early detection of cancer. SOCan aligns with the EU Mission on Cancer and will lead to an affordable and sensitive diagnosis of cancer, reducing the time to result which allows faster and specific treatment, and thereby saving lives.",

Indeed, cells in the colonic epithelium, either healthy or malignant, are in close contact to the dynamic and complex digestion matrix of our food, which may affect oncogenic processes in different ways. In our research project, we consider the consumption of red and processed meat on the one hand and fiber-rich food on the other hand as case study to investigate the role of diet in CRC. Given the unique nutritional context of colon (cancer) cells, we focus on alterations in metabolism and metabolic flexibility as markers of cancer progression.3D cell models are used, including cell line-based cancer spheroids and wild type or knock-out murine organoids. Food-derived metabolites expected in the colon as result of digestion and/or microbial fermentation are added in a chronic exposure approach to measure long-term effects rather than acute toxicity. Responses in terms of proliferation, metabolism, and communication with the tumor microenvironment are measured using extracellular flux analysis, molecular techniques, live-cell imaging, and cytokine measurements. Moreover, the impact of nutrient richness of the tumor microenvironment is investigated to evaluate the impact of dietary habits on the metabolic flexibility of cancer cells.This research may contribute to a better understanding of how the nutritional environment of cancer cells supports metabolic flexibility and of the limited success of antimetabolite therapies, and lead to more concrete nutritional recommendations for cancer patients.",

The coexistence of several cancer cell subtypes and cellular states aids with the adaptation and survival of cancer cells upon treatment, thus promoting the emergence of treatment-resistant relapse. To prevent this from occurring, it is essential to map and understand this heterogeneity and its underlaying mechanisms. As such, this calls for the use of single-cell technologies. Because proteins largely determine the phenotype of cells, we elect to study this heterogeneity at the protein level by mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics (SCP). Therefore, allowing for the direct measurement of the abundances of drug targets or proteins otherwise involved in oncogenic pathways, rather than inferring their activities from measurements at the transcript level: An approach which would miss any further mechanisms of regulation downstream from transcription including translational control and protein degradation. Therein, SCP has the potential to identify differential features which are directly related to and explanatory of the phenotype. In order to make SCP available as a research tool for, among others, cancer research, the Gevaert lab focus on refining and implementing SCP sample preparation and data analysis workflows. Within the context of my PhD research, we will apply SCP to study cellular heterogeneity in minimal residual disease in melanoma patient-derived xenograft models in collaboration with the Marine lab at the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Cancer Biology.",

Chronic low-dose intake of multiple mycotoxins are hypothesized to result in an increased risk of developing renal, hepatocellular and intestinal carcinomas. The link between mycotoxin exposure and cancer risk has mainly been established in experimental studies, and needs to be confirmed in human epidemiological studies to support the evidence-based public health strategies. Therefore, the ERC-funded HUMYCO project aims to investigate the risk for renal, hepatocellular and colorectal cancer caused by low-dose exposure of multiple mycotoxins by uniting large-scale epidemiological and mechanistic designs using poly-omics approach.The aim of our project is to set newly hypothesis-driven insights into the link of multiple mycotoxin exposure and human carcinomas. It is important to conduct accurate exposure assessments of mycotoxins at an individual-level to completely understand the health concerns in humans. Therefore, mycotoxin exposure biomarkers are used in vitro, and validated using human intervention studies by explaining human mycotoxicokinetic profiles via metabolomics. \u00a0In addition, the scope and nature of associations between external and internal dietary exposure to multiple mycotoxins and the development of renal, \u00a0hepatocellular and colorectal human carcinomas will be examined by large-scale epidemiological bio-cohorts. Furthermore, cause-and-effect relationships between multiple mycotoxin exposure and cancer will be elucidated through genetic analysis. For this purpose genome-wide mutation spectra associated with multi-exposure to suspected carcinogenic mycotoxins will be determined experimentally. These mycotoxin-induced genome mutations will be identified in mice and humans cell lines by obtaining whole-genome sequencing.",

My research topic is brain tumor cell motility. HGG cells are known to infiltrate and migrate outside the visible tumor margins, sometimes even to distant locations within the brain, i.e. the subventricular zone (SVZ). By moving away from the primary tumor, these migratory cells are not targeted by local therapy, leading to tumor progession.I aim to understand the cues for HGG cell migration as HGG cell motility may provide an innovative therapeutic opportunity. By synthetically administering migratory cues, tumor cells can be misled to a location of choice and there targeted by local therapy. In short, the tumor is attracted to be killed, a principle that we named \u2018motility trapping\u2019. The goal of this innovative strategy is to hinder tumor progression and enhance local therapy.",

The 2016 World Health Organization antenatal care guidelines suggests that pregnant women in undernourished nations should receive balanced energy-protein food supplementation. A food supplement was then developed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2016.The exposome is the totality of human environmental (i.e., non-genetic factors) exposures, starting from conception. The exposome and nutrition have a significant effect on maternal and newborn health.In the present Biospecimen Study, pregnant women (n=300) in rural Burkina Faso were individually and randomly allocated to an intervention or a control group, during pregnancy and again in the post-natal period. The intervention group received a balanced energy-protein supplementation and the standard iron folic acid tablet, whereas the control group only received the tablet. Blood, urine, stool and breastmilk samples were collected from mothers-newborns pairs according to a well-defined sampling scheme. Biospecimen analyses provide the opportunity to identify biomarkers of, both exposure and effect, that can address questions in many areas of interest, including the impact of environmental exposure to toxic compounds, such as mycotoxins and black carbon, and the supplementation effect on aging markers like the telomere length. These hypotheses will be investigated through a poly-omic approach e.g., metabolomics, metagenomics, proteomics and adductomics.In this highly innovative study, capillary blood samples collected by volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) will be used for the assessment of human exposure to multiple mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are significant to cancer research since long-term exposure can cause toxic effects such as genetic changes in target organs, resulting in cancer. Additionally, plasma and stool samples will be analysed by multi-omics profiling approaches wherein the results will unravel the discovery of useful biomarkers for cancer research.",

Being also affiliated with the biotech company argenx, my work involves the generation of therapeutic antibodies against novel targets in cancer using their proprietary SIMPLETM Antibody Platform.My focus lies on the characterization and evaluation of these therapeutic antibodies using relevant mouse models of melanoma and lung cancer to understand how novel therapies could be designed in the most effective way to trigger the immune system to kill the metastases.

As a proof of concept, I will investigate the ex vivo efficacy of these nanobodies on canine BCL-derived neoplastic B-cells in a 3D canine lymphoma model .This project will lead to better diagnostics and therapy options for dogs suffering from BCL. Apart from benefits to canine patients, a better understanding of this disease could further confirm the potential of dogs as a model for immunotherapy research in human patients.",

However, such simple monolayer cultures do not faithfully reflect the complex three-dimensional (3D) cellular context of a solid tumour. Spheroids are near spherical multicellular aggregates and are widely used as cancer models in both fundamental and translational research across academia and industry. This 3D cancer model has emerged as a powerful tool to overcome the correlation mismatch between the preclinical and clinical situation by providing more relevant and predictive data. This is for example essential in drug testing; drugs that retain their cytotoxic effect in spheroids have a greater chance of being active in cancer patients. The increased predictive power of scalable cell culture-based screenings can contribute to a reduction in animal testing and a higher success rate in clinical trials. Furthermore spheroids can be used as a biomimetic in vitro model to study fundamental mechanisms in tumour biology. Key events such as gene expression, proliferation, apoptosis and invasion are defined by the tumour microenvironment and can be monitored by using these 3D cancer models.In the first part of my PhD I investigated the impact of different culture conditions on the outcome of a spheroid experiment (MISpheroID, Nature Methods, 2021), demonstrating the importance of transparent reporting to be able to interpret and reproduce a spheroid experiment. In the next part of my PhD I will study the impact of metabolic conditions on metastasis.",

Three genetic models have been obtained for desmoid tumors in X. tropicalis by modulating the Wnt signaling pathway, which allows for genetic dependency mapping and pre-clinical drug studies. The importance of the PRC2 gene silencing complex, and the histone methyltransferase activity of EZH2, in desmoid tumorigenesis was demonstrated through the use of an in-house developed experimental pipeline (i.e. CRISPR-SID). As a dependency factor EZH2 can be targeted by the EZH2 inhibitor Tazemetostat (an FDA-approved drug for epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma). Desmoid-tumor-bearing apc crispants (F0 mosaic mutants) have been subjected to the proposed drug treatment and revealed reduction or stasis in desmoid tumor size upon treatment. Hence, our Xenopus model presents a unique platform thatallows the rapid screening and evaluation of genes contributing to tumor growth,could serve to assess the clinical relevance of novel drug targets for the treatment of desmoid tumors andcan be used for preclinical drug screening/assessment.We believe that our model offers a unique opportunity that can be easily incorporated into the research lines of several groups active in the field of desmoid tumor research and thus can contribute to the development of a cure.",

By providing insights into the cost implications, potential outcome improvements, and educational aspects of oART, our findings can inform decision-making by healthcare providers, policymakers, and researchers.This project contributes to multidisciplinary cancer research by bridging the gap between clinical innovation and implementation. Our approach not only offers valuable insights for improving radiotherapy practices but also provides a framework that can be adapted to other clinical settings beyond our specific focus on OMD.

This is mainly attributable to the advanced stages of this disease, as the cure rate drops from more than 90% in localized disease (stage I) to approximately 65% after involvement of locoregional lymph nodes (stage III). As a consequence, there is a prominent need for new curative treatment strategies. Unfortunately, there is currently not sufficient knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms to develop these. Indeed, despite the obvious importance of lymphatic spread, it has not yet been established how colon cancer lymph node metastasis progresses in space and time.During my PhD, we will therefore try to develop a new treatment that targets colon cancer lymph node metastases by modulating the locoregional lymph node immune environment. For this, we will explore the immune contexture in mesenteric lymph nodes of colon cancer patients via flow cytometry, scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics. Based on (pre-)metastatic changes emerging from these analyses, we will select a target that we can exploit for modulating the lymph node immune environment. To allow integration into the current standard of care, we will develop an intraperitoneally nebulizable nanoparticle for delivery of an immune modulating cargo into the lymph nodes. In the end, we will study the anti-tumor potential of these nanoparticles in a spontaneous lymph node metastasizing colon cancer mouse model that we will establish in-house via endoscopy-guided microinjection.",

DCs function as important sentinels by sampling the environment for danger signals and cancer antigens and subsequently alerting T-lymphocytes to mount an adequate immune response against the tumor. However, tumors can corrupt the function of DCs in order to escape immune control. The lab is currently exploring the therapeutic potential of immunostimulatory DCs, generated ex vivo from patient blood as a vaccine regimen in ongoing clinical trials.My research at the Tumor Immunology lab will now exploit our knowledge on DC biology on top of the expertise in RNA vector design combined with in vitro and in vivo immunological readouts in order to design a novel mRNA vector for use in our next-generation DC vaccine.",

In order to understand individual cell functions as part of this complex microenvironment, various single-cell analysis methods have been developed throughout the last decade. Although cell function is the ultimate result of coordinated protein activities, the vast majority of single-cell technologies are based on RNA-sequencing workflows. Such approaches have several inherent limitations:On a global scale, mRNA and protein abundances are poorly correlated and mRNA abundance measurements do not reliably reflect corresponding protein activities;The relatively low copy numbers of mRNA molecules result in counting noise, thus limiting the quantitative accuracy of RNA-seq measurements. This is particularly problematic for low-abundance transcripts.RNA-based approaches cannot account for post-translational regulation.Recent advances in sample preparation and instrumentation have placed mass spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics (SCP) as a viable complementary tool for untargeted single-cell analysis, regularly quantifying around 2000 proteins per cell. Based on the cellenONE single-cell isolation platform installed in June 2023, the Gevaert lab is now establishing single-cell proteomics workflows for various applications in health sciences and basic research.Despite constant improvements in (targeted) cancer therapies, many patients eventually develop treatment-resistant relapses. Interestingly, many of these recurrent tumors are not accompanied with distinct genetic or transcriptomic changes, a situation referred to as \u2018non-genetic resistance\u2019. Using our state-of-the-art instrumentation, we are developing SCP methods to dissect the proteomic changes associated with treatment resistance, with a main focus on melanoma and lung cancer (drs. Emin Araftpoor).",

By diagnosing patients at an early stage of the disease, one can increase the applicability of curative therapeutic options and decrease disease-related mortality. Liver transplantation (LT) is recommended as the first-line treatment option for HCC patients meeting the Milan criteria without qualifying for resection. These Milan criteria are used to keep the risk of recurrence after LT as low as possible. Nevertheless, 15% of the HCC patients still show tumour recurrence after LT. Therefore, there is a clinical unmet need for biomarkers with the potential of individual risk stratification for HCC recurrence after LT. Serum glycomics, or the evaluation of glycoprotein-specific glycan characteristics in serum, appear to be a promising approach because the majority of N-glycans present in total serum are bound to proteins made by the liver. Thus, protein glycomic alterations in serum might reflect a disruption of liver function and could potentially be used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in HCC patients undergoing LT. Therefore, the adoption of personalised medicine in this area, based on potent biomarkers accounting for the biological activity of the tumour, could significantly alter clinical practice.",

As MASLD can progress to hepatic inflammation (steatohepatitis), fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is important to identify the underlying risk factors to implement effective preventive measures. Studies have shown that maternal obesity increases the risk of MASLD in children, therefore we hypothesize that maternal obesity will also accelerate the development of offspring HCC, at a considerably younger age. Our interest is to further elucidate this and to investigate possible preventive measures in MASLD and its progression to liver fibrosis and liver cancer using in vivo models.",

These delivery systems aim to eradicate primary tumors and distant tumors by activating the immune microenvironment.I developed a gold-DNA nanocluster for photo-immunotherapy targeting tumors. This system uses methylene blue intercalated within the gold-DNA nanocluster for dual-light activated photo-immunotherapy. By exploiting a CpG sequence as a template for DNA polymer, nucleic acids are delivered to dendritic cells, activating the tumor immune microenvironment and preventing distant tumor growth.I also developed a programmed antigen-releasing hydrogel actuated by CAP irradiation. While previous clinical trials have used CAP for residual tumor removal, its limited penetration depth has restricted its effectiveness in treating primary tumors. Our findings show that the CAP-activated hydrogel system can sustain the release of tumor antigens and a TGF-beta inhibitor, leading to an increased anti-tumor immune response and the eradication of both primary and distant tumors. These results highlight the potential of the CAP-responsive in situ hydrogel system as a promising therapeutic platform to overcome the depth-related limitations of CAP in treating primary tumors.",

The enzyme complex mainly responsible is N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA). Mutations in the genes encoding the subunits play a role in multiple disorders, including cancer. Depending on the context, they can act both as oncogenes or as tumor suppressors. An example is NAA10 which codes for NAA10p, the catalytic subunit of NatA. NAA10p has a major role in proliferation, migration, differentiation and more, affecting numerous downstream targets.Using various cell lines carrying mutations in NAA10, I am applying several mass spectrometry-based techniques to identify changes in secondary and tertiary protein structures on a proteome scale. These techniques include Thermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) and Limited Proteolysis-Coupled Mass Spectrometry (LiP-MS). The aim is to gain fundamental insights in how defective N-terminal acetylation affects protein conformation and stability, supporting potential applications in many areas of cancer research.",

Changes in gut motility are often associated with indications of inflammation. Several studies suggest a link between chronic constipation and colorectal cancer, also known as colon cancer, which is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide. Moreover, these pathologies share some underlying causative mechanisms, such as microbial dysbiosis, immune activation, NF-kB signaling and inflammation. Using a new and unique genetic mouse model for slow-transit constipation, I will further investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that control constipation and evaluate if constipation can (in)directly lead to or increase the risk for colorectal cancer. My research is focused on intestinal epithelial cell signaling, in particular the regulation of hormone-secreting enteroendocrine cells (EEC). A better understanding of the role of EECs in constipation and colorectal cancer can contribute to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. In my research, I make use of several in vitro cell models such as colon organoids, and the mouse as in vivo model.",

The results will help clinicians globally with their diagnosis, grading and prognosis of canine mast cell tumors. The methods to obtain these results could potentially be extrapolated to the diagnosis of other tumors in other species such as humans.Different parameters such as degree of proliferation and differentiation of these cells & metastasis to other organs define the gradation and thus the prognosis for the dog. With histology we will use a marker (c-kit) to highlight these proliferating and differentiating mast cells in the tumor of origin, in the metastatic/draining lymph nodes and in the immune environment (inflammation within and around the tumor) of the tumor. To quantify these cells and to obtain an overview of the distribution of all components (mast cells, inflammation, \u2026) in the tumor, we will use artificial intelligence as a replacement for the human eye.Additionally, we will try to find biomarkers to predict the potential malignancy of the tumors in an early stage.",

At the same time, the immunogenicity of malignant cells has been accepted as a critical determinant of efficacy in cancer therapy. Defined cytotoxic agents promote the generation of anticancer immune responses, potentially leading to tumor eradication by inducing, in malignant cells, immunogenic cell death (ICD). ICD is an umbrella term covering different regulated cell deaths. At first, it was determined that a particular type of apoptosis, driven by endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress, could promote ICD, then necroptosis followed. In 2020, we demonstrated for the first time that ferroptosis is also immunogenic, but the specific mechanism is still not fully understood.My research aims to better understand themolecular mechanisms of ICDinduced by different regulated cell death modalities anddevelop strategies to trigger and improve ICD, focusing on the role of thetumor microenvironment. This knowledge will be used to formulate anticancer vaccines based on cells or dendritic cells.",

Mycotoxins are natural secondary metabolites produced by fungi, present in food worldwide. POPs are chemicals that persist in the environment due to their extensive use in industrial and agricultural applications. Chronic exposure to these contaminants has been linked to severe health effects, including increased cancer risk & endocrine disruption, with young people being especially vulnerable to the latter. Human biomonitoring allows for accurate assessment of exposure at the individual level, integrating all sources of exposure. For large-scale population studies, work flow automation and minimally-invasive microsampling methods such as volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) have gained increasing attention.My research focuses on developing an automated VAMS-based method for the analysis of mycotoxin and POP biomarkers, using robotics for an automated sample preparation, and LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS. This method will be applied on the Flemish Environment and Health Studies (FLEHS) cohorts (5 cycles from 2002-2027, n\u22652,100), which offers a unique prospect to investigate the exposure of adolescents (aged 14-15 years). Reference values of the contaminants will be established to identify highly exposed subgroups and enable comparisons with established toxicity benchmarks (e.g. human biomonitoring-guidance values) to perform risk assessments. To identify exposure sources, the biomonitoring results will be correlated with food consumption data, which can lead to personalized preventive nutrition and food safety measures. In addition, time series analysis of all FLEHS samples will be performed to evaluate the impact of climate change on exposure levels and the effectiveness of past public health efforts designed to reduce these levels.",

We obtain penetrant tumor development in F0 animals via CRISPR/Cas-mediated editing of (multiple) tumor suppressor genes. Interestingly, the external embryonic development of Xenopus allows us to restrict the introduction of oncogenic mutations to cell lineages of interest. This via targeted microinjections of the CRISPR/Cas reagents into specific blastomeres of the X. tropicalis embryos. Additionally, the amphibians have a true diploid genome with high synteny to the human counterpart, which are valuable characteristics for genetic research.Multiplexed CRISPR/Cas gene targeting and subsequent genetic analyses of tumors allows straightforward identification of oncogenic drivers and other genes essential for tumor growth and formation. As such, the CRISPR/Cas-based X. tropicalis cancer models can serve to (i) elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underly cancer development and (ii) identify cancer vulnerabilities that may serve as new anchor points for molecular therapies. Overall, these X. tropicalis models present a unique platform within the field of preclinical cancer modeling.",

The detection of biomarkers in liquid biopsies such as blood is becoming increasingly important in a clinical context. Often, disease-specific proteins in liquid biopsies are tissue leakage proteins (TLPs), derived from tissues directly affected by the disease and thus early signs of this disease. However, such TLPs tend to occur at low concentrations, requiring sensitive approaches. One of the most sensitive means to detect proteins is mass spectrometry, and the most recent development in this field is data-independent acquisition (DIA) technology. Yet, even though DIA is the most popular protein biomarker discovery technology in clinical practice, there are still opportunities to improve the sensitivity of detection with more advanced bioinformatics and statistics approaches. This is especially important for the reliable detection of low abundance TLPs, which will benefit from a tissue-specific protein expression catalogue. This because it currently is difficult to allocate detected protein markers to their tissue(s) of origin.I will here therefore develop the bioinformatics components needed to enable sensitive DIA for TLPs.\u00a0I will moreover integrate these components into a complete workflow, which I will then validate on both public data, as well as on relevant in-house data from clinical samples in neurodegenerative disease and cancer contexts.",

Accumulating evidence also links Themis to inflammatory diseases, yet the structural and mechanistic basis of these functions remain poorly understood.

Therefore, our team is focussing on identifying novel GR-based strategies that uphold therapeutic effects and dampen side effects. In this context, we are exploring GR-based nuclear receptor crosstalk as a way towards therapeutic innovation with more precise acting nuclear receptor ligands. \u00a0Complementary to this, we are studying the mechanisms that govern glucocorticoid responsiveness in lymphoid malignancies, which is required to find strategies that could postpone or overcome glucocorticoid resistance altogether.",

Second, because they are magnetic, the particles can be controlled remotely, allowing for example the targeted delivery of medicine to diseased sites (i.e. drug targeting). Furthermore, their magnetic response can be measured non-invasively to find their location in the human body. A third interesting property is their ability to generate heat when applying the appropriate magnetic fields (i.e. magnetic hyperthermia). This increases the temperature of the surrounding tissue and hence can be used to destroy malignant cells.Four main research topics on these particles are considered:advancing biomedical applications of these particles such as drug targeting, magnetic hyperthermia and disease detection and investigate possible combinations of applications in diagnostics and therapy (i.e. theranostics)development and analysis of non-invasive imaging techniques to localize the magnetic nanoparticles, in order for the applications to be safe and efficient (e.g. only unhealthy tissue is heated and targeted) and possible parallel use of application and imagingimprove modelling of nanoparticle interactions and behavior (in the body and between particles)use of machine learning techniques, big data and inverse problems in particle modelling",

To that end, the project will identify hard-to-reach women and design a screening strategy to access them. This strategy includes the development of a user-friendly, low-cost, portable self-sampling screening tool which will be able to detect 14 high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types and 2 proteomic cervical cancer biomarkers.The simultaneous detection of HPV DNA with the proteomic marker will allow for more accurate detection of HPV infections associated with cervical cancer progression. Therefore more relevant patients can be detected and treated, thereby drastically reducing the cancer burden in these populations. An intervention during which the self-testing device will be piloted in hard-to-reach communities in Belgium, Portugal, Ecuador and Brazil will provide information about the acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the tool.Laboratory Bacteriology Research is involved in Elevate in the co-development of the DNA part of the tool and the clinical evaluation.Breast cancer, vulvovaginal atrophy and the vaginal microbiotaBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with 1 in 8 women being diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. The vast majority of breast cancer tumors are hormone-sensitive, meaning that these cancer cells are influenced and can be stimulated by female hormones. One of the fundamental components of breast cancer treatment is anti-hormonal therapy, which prevents female hormones in the body from exerting their influence. The development of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is one of the side effects of this treatment, with a clear impact on the quality of life (sexuality, daily functioning, self-image, etc.).Breast cancer patients with VVA are often not treated for it due to physicians' reluctance to initiate local hormones, the best treatment for VVA, out of fear of recurrence, despite earlier studies showing no increase in recurrence with the use of this local treatment. Furthermore, there is still a taboo surrounding this topic, and discussing VVA symptoms is a difficult barrier for many patients.This study aims to compare the available hormonal and non-hormonal treatment options, research that is currently lacking, with the main objectives being a direct comparison for both efficacy and safety. For this comparison, patient-reported outcomes measurements and standard clinical evaluation tests (vaginal pH, microscopic examination, etc.) will be used. The following treatments will be included: estrogen, DHEA, hyaluronic acid, and probiotics. Since probiotics have proven highly effective in certain intestinal diseases, we want to investigate whether the use of probiotics can contribute to the treatment of VVA in breast cancer patients.Thus, this study aims to emphasize and highlight the treatment options for VVA, reducing the barrier for patients to discuss their symptoms with treating physicians and for physicians to treat patients with both VVA and breast cancer. In doing so, we can contribute to improving the quality of life for breast cancer patients.Laboratory Bacteriology Research will study the impact of the different treatments on the vaginal microbiota.",

Glycobiology, a new scientific field, describes various post-translational modifications of saccharides on glycoproteins in malignant processes. With NIRS, these tumors and their glycosylation patterns were studied.Based on NIRS, malignant SGTs could be differentiated. By enzymatic treatment of SGT tissue sections with neuraminidase, terminal sialicyl groups were removed. This experiment enabled us to show a difference in the spectral reactions, suggesting greater presence of terminal sialic acid groups in more malignant tumors.Further enzymatic treatments of SGTs and IR spectroscopy analysis may provide further insight into the biochemical structure helping to differentiate these particular tumors. The combination of NIRS to microscopy in vibrational microspectroscopy will hopefully further unravel the biochemistry of SGT section margins.",

Alternatively, the tumor entity can be analyzed via liquid biopsies, where information is extracted from fragmented tumor DNA in the blood. Since liquid biopsies are obtained during a minimally invasive blood draw, it is possible to take repeated samples and apply this method in tumor follow-up during treatment and remission.In the project I am working on, I aim to analyze tumor DNA from liquid biopsies to aid tumor profiling, study heterogeneity, and follow up on tumor recurrence.",

However, to date, research has almost exclusively relied on pharmacogenomics, i.e. analyzing the genome in order to predict drug response. Pharmaco-epigenetics is an emerging field within personalized medicine that is devoted to studying non-genetic heritable causes for variability in (epi)drug response and their underlying mechanisms. One of these epigenetic mechanisms are post-translational modifications of histones (hPTMs). hPTMs play a crucial role in regulation of gene expression and have therefore been associated to several types of cancer and other diseases.The aim of my PhD project is to develop a mass spectrometry (MS)-based screening assay to predict epidrug sensitivity based on individual hPTM signatures. In particular, I will crystalize the data-independent acquisition (DIA) workflow which was optimized in our lab over the past years (hSWATH) and apply it for the first time to predict outcome of epidrug treatment in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL). In collaboration with Prof. Pieter Van Vlierberghe (Lab of Normal and Malignant Hematopoiesis, Center for Medical Genetics, UGent)), we were able to map the baseline hPTM profile of 21 T-ALL cell lines using mass spectrometry. Currently, I am treating these 21 cell lines with an epidrug library and monitoring cell viability. By matching the initial histone fingerprints of resistant versus sensitive cell lines, a predictive pattern will arise that can be used on patient samples to adjust treatment.",

This will enable us to address key questions concerning the treatment of patient-derived tumors including their tumor-micro-environment in a setting harboring a human immune system. This is of paramount importance for preclinical drug development in immunotherapy where both target antigen and effector cells are human and therefore beyond the reach of non-human animal models. We have already established 14 PDTX models of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 1 Merkel cell carcinoma (a rare type of skin tumor) and are actively developing new models. These models will be used to evaluate the mode of action and tumor eradication efficacy of novel immunotherapeutics among which huCD20 and huCD70 directed nanoCAR-T cells and a novel class of targeted anti-cancer therapy: AcTakines (Activity-On-Target-Cytokines).Collaboration with the Belgian Cancer Registry: determine the real-world pattern of care in adult Diffuse Large B-Cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Follicular Lymphome (FL) in Belgium.

These structures are similar to podosomes, which are present in other highly motile cells such as immune cells. Collectively, these structures are called invadosomes. Over the past years, more research has been done regarding the structure of invadosomes, but the mechanisms behind their formation and regulation remain mainly uncovered.In my research, I will use nanobodies as inhibitors of invadosome constituents to get a better understanding of their role in building up these structures. These fluorescently labeled nanobodies are introduced in cancer cells using photoporation and afterwards, their effects can be visualized using super-resolution microscopy. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind invadosome formation and dynamics can then ultimately lead to more targeted therapies for metastatic cancers, while making sure that these therapies have a minimal influence on the functionality of immune cells.",

Moreover, current treatments are either highly toxic or susceptible to rapid development of resistance.Recently however, a new therapy was discovered: immune checkpoint blockers (ICB), which prevent the downregulation of the natural immune activity towards cancer cells.Despite their proven effectiveness, only a small percentage of patients respond to treatment with ICB. Therefore, a proof-of-concept clinical trial is in development at the labs of prof. Menten and prof. Vandekerckhove, which aims to combine ICBs with an active vaccination strategy. For this vaccine, tumor specific targets will be identified for each patient. These targets are known as neoantigens which are small peptides derived from tumor specific mutations that arose during tumor formation. This proposal aims to develop a fully integrated and accurate pipeline for the identification of these neoantigen targets for use in a clinical setting. Therefore, we will employ current state-of-the-art sequencing technologies and computer algorithms and compare their predictions with the newly developed HLA ligandome sequencing. Moreover, we will evaluate their feasibility and potential to elicit an immune response during our clinical trial. Based on this evaluation, we will uncover new insights into neoantigens predictions that can improve treatment.",

Asparaginase is an enzymatic drug and an essential component of the combination chemotherapy of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). This drug depletes asparagine in the blood, and the malignant lymphoid cells that depend on extracellular asparagine will thus go into apoptosis. Monitoring is essential to identify patients with silent inactivation, and to guide the need to change or maintain therapy.Next to my main task I provide assistance in working with immunodeficient mice creating patient derived models (PdX) for preclinical compound testing and evaluation, preparing DNA/RNA and protein extractions, flow analyses and other techniques related to our projects.",

Despite the considerable progress that has been made in recent years with regard to treatment of this cancer, the general disease prognosis remains utterly dismal.A common trait amongst leukaemia patients is a global dysregulation of the splicing chemistry. \u201cSplicing\u201d refers to the excision of non-coding regions out of pre-mRNA molecules by so-called splicing factors (SFs). Splicing is an essential mechanism in the formation of mature mRNA, and thus in protein biosynthesis. While for some (haematological) malignancies these splicing anomalities can be attributed to specific SF gene mutations, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) patients only present rarely with affected SF alleles. Even so, as for several other blood cancers, splicing perturbation has been found to be a clinically relevant and \u2018drugable\u2019 target for T-ALL.Inthe Ntziachristos lab, we study how post-translational modification \u2013 especially ubiquitination \u2013 of SFs attribute to the observed splicing landscape in T-ALL, regardless of SF mutations. My personal research focusses on RNA epigenetics, or \u201cepitranscriptomics\u201d, which forms an extra layer of molecular regulation in the perturbed T-ALL splicing biology. Epitranscriptomics refers to reversible modifications of RNA, which affect the transcript\u2019s stability, translational capacity and splicing fate.In my research, I\u2019m utilizing specific molecular inhibitors (e.g. deubiquitinase inhibitors, and/or epitranscriptomics inhibitors) in cell lines and mouse models, while also performing various metabolic and transcriptomic assays (e.g. various types of RNA seq).",

However, cfDNA is highly fragmented and quantity is limited in the blood, making it also a difficult-to-handle biomolecule.During my research I have tested many different library preparation methods and encountered many problems when working with low-input and low-quality DNA samples, hence I may have to offer some technical advice to researchers performing NGS-based experiments on a similar DNA input. Moreover, I also succeeded to develop a cost-effective methylome profiling method (termed \u2018cf-RRBS\u2019) that can be used on limited amounts (nanogram range) of highly degraded DNA (cfDNA, FFPE, \u2026). cf-RRBS gives information about the methylation state of \u00b12.5 million CpGs at a cost of \u00b1200 euro per sample.Three collaborators at the Center of Medical Genetics of the UZ Ghent are currently testing this method to answer different clinical questions (e.g. in adult/pediatric oncology and pregnancy). Preliminary results show it is feasible to perform the cf-RRBS method in such clinical setting and the obtained methylation data is more than sufficient for tumor classification and biomarker discovery.In the future, we hope that the cf-RRBS technology in its whole or in part can be used in clinic and this during all phases of personalized medicine (i.e. screening, early diagnosis and prognosis, residual disease and therapy monitoring). Faster and more informative monitoring of the individual patients will eventually result in precise and more effective treatment.",

This is achieved in the context of multiple prospective, multicentre, (non-)interventional clinical studies and randomised clinical trials in close collaboration with other research groups and a multidisciplinary team of physicians and health care professionals. The ultimate goal of our research is to determine whether treatment decisions based on liquid biopsy-derived molecular profiles can significantly prolong response rates, which in turn would translate into improved overall survival. The identification of predictive biomarkers in a patient\u2019s tumour will become a prerequisite of routine diagnostics to make therapy selection patient-tailored. This is important, because the identification of a subset of patients who would not benefit from a standard-of-care treatment would mean that these patients can be spared from the side effects of this treatment and would immediately be selected for a different and more appropriate treatment strategy.",

HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), first isolated in 1983, was soon identified as the cause of this disease. Years of research have led to the finding of a treatment for HIV, with the majority of people currently treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) having an undetectable viral load, no symptoms and a near-normal lifespan. However, HIV-positive people still live with a chronic disease that cannot be cured, requiring lifelong treatment, due to viral rebound when treatment is interrupted.Extracellular vesicles (EV) are nanometer-sized membrane vesicles released by different cell types, among which eukaryotic cells (eukaryotic or EEV). Bioactive molecules such as different RNA species, DNA and proteins are actively packed into EV allowing for horizontal transfer of the molecules to recipient cells in the body. Therefore, EV play an important role in intercellular communication and cancer metastasis. Evidence is accumulating that EV not only play a role in cancer but also in viral infections. With this doctorate we aim to identify the role of EV throughout different stages of HIV infection - before and after treatment is initiated.",

Recent advances in therapeutic strategies have improved patient outcome, but despite these efforts, GB still remains a clinical challenge. Consequently, there is an urgent demand for novel therapeutic strategies to improve survival outcome. Target-based therapeutics are promising for GB as they aim to precisely inhibit molecular pathways that are critical to tumor growth and maintenance, while sparing healthy tissue.Our research group is currently investigating two target-based therapeutics for GB in the F98 rat model. The first therapeutic strategy targets connexin-mediated communication essential in the microenvironment, pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance of GB.\u00a0The second therapeutic strategy is prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) - targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT).",

The potential of these curcuminoid \u2018hit-structures\u2019 to selectively target colon cancer cells is evaluated in this project. Therefore, novel intestinal 3D co-culture models including cells of both cancer and non-cancer origin are being developed. In addition to high-throughput viability assays, microscopic, analytical and molecular techniques are applied to unravel potential links between structure, intracellular bioavailability and -activity. The results of this research enable selection of the most promising candidates for follow-up studies, which may eventually lead to the future application of curcuminoid-based chemotherapeutics.",

CD19 CAR T cells eradicate late stage leukemia in 70\u201390% of treated patients. This strategy uses synthetic chimeric receptors introduced in T cells consisting of a single chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal antibody to recognize specific antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells and an intracellular part containing (co)stimulatory signals derived from CD3\u03b6, CD28 and/or 4_1BB. However, the success rate in patients with solid tumors remains disappointing. The limited therapeutic efficacy is the result of the typical tumor microenvironment and the presence of negative regulators of T cell response. These key hallmarks of solid tumors warrant the development of better CAR structures to induce a durable response.We are studying the potential differences in T cell response in both solid and liquid malignancies and develop the most optimal CAR structure to target each malignancy. A first modification we have done to the standard CAR structure is the replacement of the scFv by a nanobody. These single antigen-binding domains are isolated from the heavy chain only antibodies from Camilidae. They can be cloned, easily expressed and retain the affinity for the specific antigen. Their strict monomeric behavior and their small size makes them ideal building blocks for multidomain constructs such as CARs. We are testing these nanoCARs in different in vitro and in vivo models of both solid as liquid malignancies.",

Nevertheless, upon diagnostic testing in patients with a presumed genetic predisposition, significant numbers of variants of unknown significance (VUS) are identified in BRCA2. For patients carrying these VUS, clinical data and in vitro functional assays are often insufficient to determine cancer risks, which are essential to apply risk-reducing interventions, targeted therapies or to offer presymptomatic testing to family members.The general aim of this project is to set up in vivo functional assays for testing VUS in BRCA2 by developing an efficient CRISPR/Cas9\u2010based workflow to knock-in variants in the zebrafish genome and subsequently test their pathogenicity. This will contribute to accurate classification of VUS in BRCA2 and lead to more adequate genetic counselling, clinical and therapeutic management of cancer patients and their relatives.We will compare homology directed repair, base editing, and the recently developed prime editing approach and assess their feasibility for accurately knocking-in VUS in the zebrafish brca2 gene. Moreover, proof-of-concept data will be generated for efficient brca2-VUS causality testing in zebrafish by using an in-house developed toolset of functional read-outs, which we will further expand with promising new assays.",

Cameras mounted on the ceiling make 3D-surface scans of the patient during the treatment session. However, patients who are treated in prone position cannot be visualized properly as the breast area is located away from the cameras. My second research interest is to find a solution for this problem by investigating how we can install additional cameras that can accurately construct a 3D-image of the breast area. Thereafter, our research group will work on the implementation of the optimizations for breast cancer radiotherapy in the clinic.These implementations will further improve the setup procedure and the precision of prone breast radiotherapy.",

Therefore, they are gaining huge interest in cancer research and could constitute novel anticancer targets. In line with the majority of existing anticancer therapies, we aim to covalently target these structures, using our furan-based cross-linking platform, previously developed within our research group. However, given the omnipresence of the targeted G4 and iM structures, there is a need for structure-specificity and sequence-specificity. To achieve this, we are exploiting a system that combines ligands, targeting a specific secondary structure, and oligonucleotide analogues, allowing the recognition of a specific sequence.",

Recent reports even suggest at least 10 % of childhood cancer developed because of un underlying CPS. Hitherto, over 100 cancer predisposition genes have already been described, all are associated with different orphan diseases.Diagnosing cancer predisposition is clinically relevant for several reasons:it may influence choice of therapypredisposed patients are at increased risk for new primary malignancies an may benefit from adjusted surveillanceas other relatives may also be at risk, predictive genetic testing can be offered to identify relatives that may benefit from surveillance and preventive measuresfinally, transmission of a mutation to offspring can be prevented with assisted reproductive techniquesHowever, multiple barriers impede adequate referral and diagnosis of CPSs in children with cancer. Several researchers have developed tools to help clinicians adequately identify patients at risk for a CPS. However, these tools have never been prospectively validated.My research project aims to study the best diagnostic strategy for identifying a CPS in children with cancer. Therefore we plan to prospectively validate the most promising referral tool (MIPOGG) in routine clinical practice. We will be using whole exome sequencing (WES) to broadly screen for cancer predisposition in our patients and will study the added value of transcriptomics. Finally, we will evaluate the psychosocial impact on patients and their family and will determine the optimal setting for genetic testing and counselling for CPS in children.",

For this purpose, we will rely on networks. Networks allow for comprehensively summarizing omics-derived prior knowledge, they are an intuitive scaffold to drive the integrative analysis of in-house data and allow studying pathways rather than genes individually, hereby providing a mechanistic view of the studied phenotype.The latter is an interesting property in the context of drug target prioritization as a particular disease gene might not be druggable but other genes that act in the same pathway might be. In the context of cancer cohort analysis, it allows identifying the less frequent drivers. In the context of precision medicine, it allows not only prioritizing actionable mutations but explains why mutations are actionable as well. This facilitates evidence-based medical decision-making.",

Single-cell omics in particular reveals cell-to-cell variability, giving insights into how individual glioblastoma cells adapt and evade treatments.In my PhD, I aim to unravel the underlying mechanisms that drive the tumor\u2019s heterogeneity and plasticity. Using a multi-omics approach, I will integrate transcriptomics and epigenomics to study the gene regulatory networks that shape glioblastoma behavior and to reveal how various genes and regulatory elements interact within this tumor. Using in silico perturbation\u2014computational simulations of genetic and therapeutic interventions\u2014I can predict potential vulnerabilities within these networks. And additionally, incorporating spatial omics enables us to observe interactions within the tumor microenvironment, offering a more complete picture of how glioblastoma cells communicate and adapt within their surroundings. By pinpointing key regulatory factors and potential vulnerabilities, my work aims to contribute to the development of more effective, personalized therapies to counteract glioblastoma\u2019s resilience. This approach supports the larger field of precision oncology by offering insights into the intricate network of molecular interactions that drive cancer progression, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for patients facing this devastating disease.",

Trials from the past 20 years all failed, highlighting the urge for clinically more beneficial therapies. The discovery of different tumor cell populations within a tumor, using next-generation sequencing methods, suggests that more clinical success will be achieved using multi-drug therapies selectively targeting the different populations. Therefore, tailoring the therapy to the patient\u2019s sample will improve clinical benefit. The development of a functional diagnostic tool, based on drug-specific biomarker identification, can assist clinicians with their decision making.

However, the success rate in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) remains disappointing.One of the major challenges associated with this disease lies in identifying a suitable target antigen, given its heterogeneity. CD70 stands out as a potentially excellent target antigen for both AML \u00a0and CTCL. CD70 is minimally expressed on normal hematopoietic cells but appears aberrantly on AML and CTCL cells. Our team has already developed a highly promising CAR-T therapy targeting CD70.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the standard of care, however event-free survival is poor. In over 90% of JMML patients, germline or somatic mutations in genes involved in the RAS signaling pathway can be found. But these mutations, nor additional secondary mutations, are unable to fully explain the phenotypic and prognostic heterogeneity of the disease. Recently it was shown that JMML patients can be classified in distinct classes of DNA methylation patterns where hypermethylation was shown to correlate with poor prognosis. Our research group has focused on the transcriptome of JMML patients and found that (non-) coding RNAs as well as circular RNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis. My PhD project aims to confirm and expand the generated circRNA data and to explore potential therapeutic applications. Furthermore, a full transcriptome and histone post-translational modification profile in patients with known genomic and DNA methylation profiles will be generated. These efforts will allow full integration of clinical, genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data in JMML patients. Integration of this data will aid in refining risk stratification and in identification of novel molecular targets with biomarker and/or therapeutic potential. Overall the project aims to elucidate JMML development and progression through integration of -omics data and hopes to result in a clinical benefit for JMML patients.",

As a pathology resident and PhD student, my aim is to improve cancer diagnosis by bringing emerging molecular techniques into clinical practice. This is especially important for patients with \u00a0CUP (Cancer of Unknown Primary), because the tissue where the tumor originated cannot be identified with conventional methods.A promising new technique is e.g. DNA methylation profiling. The DNA methylation pattern is a unique \u2018fingerprint\u2019 that can be used to determine the tissue-of-origin in CUPs. We apply methylation profiling not only to DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissue, but also to cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from liquid biopsies such as blood. Contrary to tissue biopsies, liquid biopsies are non- or minimally invasive, which accelerates the diagnostic process and significantly reduces discomfort for the patient.My research also focuses on writing new computational analysis pipelines to incorporate epigenetic data within the existing histopathological and molecular knowledge on tumor classification. I hope to build a flexible, reliable and cost-effective diagnostic test that can be a valuable addition to the pathologist\u2019s toolbox.",

However, some diseases like cancer and tuberculosis lack effective vaccines. Developing vaccines for these diseases is challenging because they heavily rely on T-cell immunity, which requires identifying specific MHC-epitopes to trigger a strong immune response. Identifying these MHC-epitopes is done through immunopeptidomics, where bound epitopes are isolated and analyzed. Though new protocols are being developed to increase sensitivity, bioinformatics tools for efficiently identifying these specific MHC-epitopes lack behind. To address this, I am developing specialized bioinformatics tools for immunopeptidomics data. This will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of available epitopes that can be used for vaccination, potentially overcoming current limitations in developing cancer and intracellular bacterial vaccines.",

Key aspects include investigating how tumor burden impacts tumor exRNA detection sensitivity, how exRNA levels evolve during disease course, treatment and follow-up, how and to what extent tumor-derived exRNAs are protected from degradation in the blood, and what their half-lives are in circulation.

The majority of HCC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, having limited therapeutic options. Although new therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy, arose for these patients, these still only provide little survival benefit, come with substantial side effects and have rather poor response rates. This urges the need for new effective treatment options.Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a large family of druggable enzymes that play a role in protein homeostasis and thereby regulate crucial cellular processes such as proliferation and survival. Hence, it is not surprising that these DUBs also control key oncoproteins involved in important cancer hallmarks. In fact, overexpression of several DUBs is associated with cancer hallmarks such as invasion and metastasis, and also worse prognosis in patients.In this project, we preclinically assess the potential of a novel therapeutic strategy by targeting these DUBs in combination with an FDA-approved first line tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Our in vitro data already show that DUB inhibition can significantly enhance the efficacy of TKIs in killing HCC cells as the combination treatment displays strong synergy. Currently, I am validating this synergy using an in vivo orthotopic xenograft HCC mouse model established within the group of my co-promotor. The final objective is to lay the groundwork for clinical trials involving DUB inhibitors, thereby advancing treatment options for patients with advanced HCC.",

The diffuse large-cell B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common histological subtype within non-hodgkin lymphomas. With the standard treatment consisting of immunochemotherapy, a sustained remission can be obtained in about 60%-70% of the patients. However, patients with refractory disease or who relapse after first-line treatment with immunochemotherapy have a reserved prognosis with a five-year survival rate of only 20%, despite second-line treatments. \u00a0These important prognostic differences in terms of response and survival may be explained by the fact that DLBCL includes a heterogeneous group of lymphomas in terms of morphology, genetics and biological behavior, which cannot be sufficiently reflected in current classification systems.The aim of this PhD is to combine DNA and gene expression data and to link these to diagnosis, clinical phenotype and response within a patient population with DLBCL. Through integrated DNA/RNA profiling, the underlying pathogenesis will be further explored in which disease-specific pathways responsible for a particular clinical phenotype will be elaborated in order to select possible therapeutic targets on the one hand and on the other hand to identify diagnostic markers associated with refractory disease or relapse.A potentially promising application in this research area is the use of circulating cell-free (tumor) DNA (cfDNA/ctDNA) and circulating cell-free (tumor) RNA (cfRNA/ctRNA) to map the molecular tumor profile at diagnosis and to use as a real-time and non-invasive biomarker for follow-up.",

We look into the use of sequencing for routine screening for MSI on paraffin-embedded biopsies (FFPE) of solid tumors.In diagnostics of brain tumors, sarcomas and carcinomas of unknown primary origin, the use of the tumoral epigentic profile, obtained by methylation-profiling is emerging. The gold standard for \u00a0methylation-profiling, with the \u00a0Illumina Methylation EPIC 850K BeadChip platform generates a methylation-profile, a copy number variation (CNV)-plot and information on the methylation-status of specific genpromoters eg. MGMT and MLH1. The groupe of Prof. Nico Callewaert (UGent-VIB) recently developed a new, cheaper technique for methylation-profiling by cf-RRBS (cell-free Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing). We investigate wether cfRRBS on FFPE generates comparable results as the golden standard regarding methylation-profile based tumorclassification, CNV-profile and methylation status of specific genpromoters.Recent findings suggest that gastric/pyloric metaplasia in the right colon is an early event in carcinogenesis in the serrated pathway characterized by the CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) often associated with MSI. The optimalisation of sequencing for MSI-detection and cf-RRBS on FFPE-material should help us to investigate the following research question: the hypothesis of gastric metaplasia as early event in the carcinogenesis along the serrated pathway in colontumors raises the question wether there is a relationship regarding methylation profile and immunohistochemical phenotype between the MSI-and/or CIMP-subgroup of colonic and gastric adenocarcinomas.",

Targeting lncRNAs is an appealing opportunity as lncRNA expression can be highly tissue-specific, potentially reducing toxic side-effects in normal cells. Nevertheless, therapeutic targeting of lncRNAs remains quite a challenging endeavor. As ASO technology is advancing in the clinic, several limitations have surfaced. Most notably, chemically modified phosphorothioate (PS) gapmer ASOs bind many intracellular proteins with high avidity, thereby mislocalizing them and altering their function and stability in an RNase H1-dependent manner, effectively inducing apoptosis and thus treatment toxicity. Steric blocking ASOs do not recruit RNase H1 as they do not contain a DNA gap, but rather are built entirely from RNA nucleotides. 2\u2019 modifications of these nucleotides, such as 2\u2019MOE, have been shown to completely mitigate the cytotoxic effects that are induced by the PS backbone. Currently 7 out of 10 clinically approved ASOs are fully modified ASOs (i.e. containing both PS and 2\u2019 modifications on all nucleotides) that block interactions between the splicing machinery and splice junctions in specific mRNAs to alter splicing. However, fully modified ASOs can also be exploited to block the binding between RNA and other proteins. To efficiently develop such ASOs, one must be able to map RNA-protein interfaces. We aim to identify RNA-protein interaction interfaces of cancer-specific lncRNAs with the intent to develop ASOs that sterically block these interactions and evaluate the therapeutic potential of these ASOs in vivo.",

Even though the current treatment leads to high cure rates, it can also lead to long-term harmful side-effects, like infertility, loss of intellectual capacity and the development of secondary tumors. Furthermore, a significant number of T-ALL patients relapse and become refractory to intensive treatment, indicating the need for a less toxic and targeted therapy.By using transgenic mice models, our laboratory wants to characterize new dependency genes and its downstream targets. So that we can have a better understanding of the pathways involved in T-ALL initiation and maintenance, and in that way we want to develop more targeted therapies.",

Currently more than 12 sub-types of cell death have been described including ICD, being immunogenic apoptosis and immunogenic necroptosis. In general, ICD is characterized by the emission of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs, such as ATP, HMGB1, calreticulin, nuclear and mitochondrial DNA) and/or cytokines/chemokines, leading to the induction of strong anti-tumor immune responses. It has been shown that cancer cells gain resistance towards both immunogenic apoptosis and necroptosis, this fact leads to a further investigation of other types of ICD and their application in anti-cancer therapy.It is known that the tumor microenvironment can affect the outcome of anti-cancer therapy and cancer spheroids are more accurate in representing the tumor microenvironment. The aim of this project is to fully understand the immuno-modulatory role of the tumor microenvironment in cancer spheroids on ICDin vitroandin vivo.",

The cells which make up this peritoneum, mesothelial cells, have been shown to be able to influence cancer progression. Cancer cells can communicate with many types of cells, and influence healthy cells to help cancer cells grow. This leads to the presence of several types of normally healthy cells in a tumour. One of the main components in this tumor microenvironment is the cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF). In the peritoneum, cancer cells influence mesothelial cells to make the peritoneum, which normally defends against cancer spreading, into an environment where cancer cells can grow by transforming mesothelial cells into CAFs. \u00a0This process, dubbed mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, has not yet been studied in colorectal cancer.We will utilize novel techniques such as ScRNAseq to accurately define what types of cells are present in the microenvironment of tumours which have spread to the peritoneum. With this new technique, we are able to determine the transcriptome of single cells in the microenvironment. This way, we can determine the functions and origins of components of the microenvironment.We will perform subsequent experiments to find out how cancer cells communicate with mesothelial cells, and how mesothelial cells help colorectal cancer grow. Later on, we will try to disrupt this communication utilizing SiRNA and see if this strategy might be useful to develop new treatments for treating or preventing colorectal cancer spreading to the peritoneum.",

The currently employed intensive therapies for high-risk cases still achieves disappointingly low perspective for cure, with less than 50% survival rates. In addition, patients that do survive suffer from serious long-term side-effects, including secondary cancer later in life. Therefore, it is necessary to explore more efficient and less harmful therapeutic alternatives. Given this urgent medical need, we aim to better understand the molecular basis of tumorigenesis to allow identification of putative new therapeutic targets and/or new biomarkers to predict tumor progression and therapeutic responses.Some tumors, including neuroblastoma cells, undergo increased replication fork stalling and replicative stress, which makes these cells more dependent on proteins implicated in cell cycle regulation, checkpoint control and replicative stress response pathways to overcome genomic instability and apoptosis, while allowing high proliferation status. During my postdoctoral fellowship, I will further build upon the interesting observations I obtained during my PhD regarding the dependency of neuroblastoma cells on these replicative stress and DNA damage response pathways; while further exploring their therapeutic potential using both in vitro as well as in vivo models.",

        "research_focus": "My first research topic is devoted to pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenomics studies the impact of genetic variation (single nucleotide variants, insertions, deletions, and structural variants) on drug function. Genetic variation underlying drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g. CYP2D6), can alter the level of the active substance (e.g. the cancer drug tamoxifen) that can exert pharmacological effects. Multiple platforms exist to screen for these genetic variations, however, most strategies only screen for known variations (cf. microarrays) or are based on PCR and short-read next-generation sequencing. Due to these limitations, correctly identifying combinations of variants in a haplotype-aware context is difficult. Therefore, we focus on method optimization for targeted long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing to characterize the genetic variation in patients with the goal to improve genotyping and more accurately predict drug function.In a second research line, I focus on plate-based single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). scRNA-seq has revolutionized the field of transcriptomics. However, the main focus has been on high-throughput sequencing of thousands of cells for gene expression purposes. In contrast, protocols for settings in which few cells are available, or for which full-transcriptome coverage is desired, have been studied less extensively. Therefore, we adopted the recently published Smart-seq3xpress protocol and perform method optimization to characterize the total transcriptome, aiming to reveal rare coding and non-coding transcripts involved in cancer pathways.",

It affects healthy patients (de novo) as well as patients that already have an underlying hematological disorder, as a side-effect of chemo/radiation therapy. The myeloid subtype hits an older population, while the lymphoblastic subtype is the most common childhood cancer. Although patient-specific intensification of the chemotherapeutic regime and stem cell transplantation has led to improved outcomes for younger patients, prognosis in adults remains poor and the majority of these patients die of relapsed, refractory disease. Current research efforts are focused on the search for novel therapeutic targets and the development of more effective and less toxic anti-leukemic drugs.In my research, I aim to target key transcription factors in important leukemia pathways. As such, we are convinced that temporal perturbation of their function, could represent a novel therapeutic opportunity for acute leukemia patients. In general, transcription factors are considered as \u2018undruggable\u2019 according to conventional approaches, and often seen as too risk-full candidates to be explored in the drug-discovery pipelines of pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, advances in the field, e.g. the introduction of small-molecule protein-protein/DNA interaction disruptors and proteolysis-targeted chimaeras (PROTAC), have changed the definition of \u2019druggable\u2019 over the last years. New technologies give us the opportunity to explore novel assays e.g. nanoBRET, thermal shift assays, AlphaScreen technology,\u2026 that pave the way for developing therapeutic strategies targeting transcription factors.",

With this picture also comes the growing sense that it is the interplay between all these different biochemical changes that dictates the final biological outcome. However, studying the proverbial grammar emerging from the combination of hPTMs, the so-called \u201chistone code\u201d, still not is common ground because traditionally, hPTM sites on histones are individually detected by immunoblotting assays. However, in the last couple of years mass spectrometry (MS) has been gaining momentum in histone epigenetics research because of its intrinsically untargeted nature.Only a few groups worldwide are currently dedicated to this MS-based study of the histone code and the labPhBT is considered one of them. Yet, the potential of analyzing the histone code using mass spectrometry is practically limitless: all studies involving Eukaryotes, both fundamental and applicable, can benefit from a better understanding of the dynamics of the histone code. In this context, targeted antibody-based approaches already have given a lot of evidence for the role of individual hPTM in cancer, and a bird\u2019s eye view would open up a new era.Currently, we are applying three different MS acquisition strategies to study hPTM dynamics on different cell lines. Together, we can monitor the dynamics of a few hundred hPTM combinations in a single experiment. Within the year we aim at a pipeline in place to analyze any cell sample from the CRIG consortium, as part of ourProGenTomicsservice lab (www.progentomics.be). This will result in new insights on hPTM connectivity in cancer, the creation of databases containing histone fingerprints of e.g. medicine-induced changes and hopefully in the opportunity to move into classifying epigenetic fingerprints of patient tissues.",

Extracellular vesicles (EV) are released by viable cells and are detected in every body fluid. EV based liquid biopsies provide dynamic information from tumors at the time of collection.

However, a number of complex factors such as acquired drug resistance, drug efficacy, mutation in oncoproteins, drug toxicity, lower protein-drug binding affinity have attributed to the failures of various computational tools that are focused on protein-drug interactions in cancer.The standard methods in protein-drug interactions involve rigid-body docking of protein-ligand(s) (an ion, small-molecule drugs, conserved water molecules). In addition, they do not address the dynamic and conformational behaviour of proteins and ligands which can be affected by mutations, post-translational modifications such as glycosylation further affecting their binding affinity. Therefore, for the accurate diagnosis, monitoring and treatment in cancer there is a need to develop accurate biophysical fingerprints of protein-drug interactions that correspond with sequence variants, molecular dynamics of protein-ligand, post-translational modifications as well as drug pharmacodynamics.The main objective of the research project is the development of new methodological and computational solutions implemented as a freely available web-based atlas for prediction of response to drugs through prediction of binding sites and their ligands, and prediction of the effects of sequence variants on binding affinity and dynamics for drug molecules enabling inferences in drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.",

Affected patients are more prone to genomic instability, have high cancer risk and often display an enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation.The goal of this PhD is to investigate the involvement of the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway in the radiosensitivity of PID patients. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of radiosensitivity in these PID patients will allow modifications in screening modalities, more targeted therapies and may help in the development of novel therapies.",

Despite the substantial progress in MM treatment, the vast majority of MM patients eventually relapse. On top of that, current treatments go along with severe side effects, underlining the need for new therapeutics that work via a novel mode of action. Therefore, our (chemistry-oriented) research group SynBioC aims at developing novel therapeutic strategies against MM, following a multi-target approach, in collaboration with the lab of Prof. K. De Bosscher (Faculty of Medicine, UGent).In the first approach, we develop novel inhibitors for the HDAC6 enzyme, a member of the histone deacetylase family which consists of 18 isozymes and mediate the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues. HDAC inhibitors can act on 11 HDAC isozymes, but isoform-selective inhibition is important with respect to clinical efficacy. In particular, HDAC6 has been identified as a relevant target because of its unique features: it is located in the cytoplasm, has two catalytic domains and a ubiquitin-binding domain and mediates, amongst other cellular processes, the trafficking of ubiquitinated misfolded proteins to the aggresome/autophagy pathway. Therefore, this isozyme is an important target to combat MM when combined with proteasome inhibitors (PIs), as this strategy would allow overcoming resistance to PIs. The second approach is situated on the nuclear receptor level. Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs), such as dexamethasone and prednisolone, bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and induce apoptosis of MM cells. GCs are administered in all stages of MM treatment, but evoke adverse side effects and are subject to a rising resistance. Therefore, we aim to improve glucocorticoid efficacy and circumvent therapy resistance through exploitation of a recently discovered alternative mode of action involving the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).Other cancer-related research projects in our group concern the development and assessment of new curcumin-based structures, in collaboration with Prof. J. Van Camp (Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, UGent). Although curcumin has amply shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, this molecule has also been described to possess a low bioavailability, which is related to poor absorption. Moreover, curcumin is rapidly metabolized and systemically eliminated from the body, suffers from chemical degradation in aqueous solutions, and shows rather unspecific activity across a range of assays. These drawbacks imply a serious concern and hamper potential applications of curcumin-like compounds in health care, pointing to the need for new, preferably three-dimensional entities starting from the curcumin mother structure, of course without compromising its pronounced biological activities",

Our research group demonstrated that these altered N-glycosylation patterns hold promise as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer. Currently, we are exploring the use of N-glycosylation as diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer by the use of capillary electrophoresis (collaboration with VIB-UGent [unit Nico Callewaert]). The objective of this research is to develop and validate a urinary biomarker that we can implement in daily practice for the diagnosis of (aggressive) prostate cancer.",

Historically, TFs were considered \u2018undruggable\u2019 according to conventional approaches. Nowadays, novel therapeutic approaches are changing the rules of \u2018druggability\u2019, especially Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs). They are heterobifunctional molecules that possess a target protein (POI) recruiting group linked to an E3 ligase interacting moiety. PROTACs catalyze event-driven protein degradation, through recruitment of the E3 ligase which promotes polyubiquitination of the POI and its ensuing degradation in the proteasome by the ubiquitin-proteasome-system.We are convinced that PROTAC technology is a successful and safe therapeutic strategy for targeting TFs in acute leukemia.In particular I am involved in the design, synthesis and in the preliminary biological evaluation of small molecules and PROTACs against important TFs in acute leukemia.",

Approximately one in four patients present with distant metastases at primary diagnosis, a condition associated with a very poor prognosis\u2014i.e. a five-year survival rate of 11%. The second most common region for metastases to occur is the membrane lining the abdomen, termed the peritoneum. To date, peritoneal metastases (PM) are being treated by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by a hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) treatment. This treatment, however, is suboptimal since approximately 75% of these patients will relapse within 3 years. This high recurrence rate can in part be explained by the immunosuppressive status of the peritoneum after surgery which enhances the immune escape of residual cancer cells.During my PhD we will try to find a new treatment for colorectal PM, based on locoregional (intraperitoneal) immune modulation, in which we want to engineer the tumor microenvironment (TME) in such a way that the immunosuppressive peritoneum can be converted in a more immunostimulatory environment. Based on recent evidences in the literature, we will focus on intraperitoneal administration of toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. To study our hypothesis efficiently, we will establish a syngeneic CRC PM mouse model, as well as a clinically relevant tumoroid model. We thus hope that locoregional stimulation of specific TLRs, either alone or in synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors, might be an effective treatment for colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis.",

Nevertheless, existing predictive biomarkers cannot accurately separate non-responders from responders and require invasive tumor tissue sampling. Lately, evidence accumulates that tumor regressions under ICIs are reflected by changes in specific immune cells in peripheral blood. That\u2019s why I aim to develop a blood-based test that interrogates these systemic immune profile signatures. The prediction of immune cell types on bulk samples will be guided by single cell data. The predicted immune content will subsequently be used as an input to train predictive models for immunotherapy response. Additionally, I will map the immune interactome of responders and non-responders, sampled from the tumor microenvironment, lymph nodes and blood, to explore differences. In conclusion, this research project will bring us closer to deliver a non-invasive test for immunotherapy-treated lung cancer patients and understand the differences between responders and non-responders.",

The molecular composition of liquid biopsies such as plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or exhale breath condensate (EBC) reflect the status of the body. The majority of proteins that compose liquid biopsies are specific, yet a small amount of proteins may leak from damaged solid organs. These leakage proteins may provide evidences of what is going on in the body and likely reflect changes in affected organs.Our research focusses on searching for these tissue leakage proteins. We develop specific proteomics workflows and use high-end mass spectrometers to identify proteins with deregulated levels in liquid biopsies among healthy and disease cohorts, allowing us to spot potential protein biomarkers.",

However, for the more frequent solid tumor types (carcinomas, lymphomas), clearance of advanced-stage tumors, and especially the subsequent long-term protection, is only rarely achieved. The main reason for this is the multi-pathway immunosuppressive environment that these tumors evolve to overcome the selective pressure imposed by the patient\u2019s immune system. This both hampers the initial attack by CAR-Ts, and often leads to low numbers of long-term persisting CAR-T cells, which tend to be in a state of functional exhaustion. Most attempts at overcoming this, target particular CAR-T cell proteins involved in individual pathways of immunosuppression. However, it is clear from early-stage clinical trials with such engineered CAR-T cells that multiple pathways will need to be tackled at the same time.Inspired by this challenge, we have chosen a different path. As the glycans decorating the T cell surface are implicated in T cell activation, differentiation, proliferation, and in the interaction of human T cells with tumor cells, we study the role of human T cell glycosylation in more depth by manipulating the glycome of CAR-T cells. The unique property of glycosylation pathways is that they often modulate a large range of cell surface receptor biology at the same time.We use CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering to induce mutations/deletions in specific pathways in CAR-T cells. The structure and function of the altered CAR-T-cells is being investigated in vitro and in vivo in different mouse cancer models.",

High-grade sarcomas have the propensity to metastasize in 50-80% of patients and once metastasized, they have a 5-year overall survival of only 16%, partly due to the limited treatment options. No biomarkers are available to predict the efficacy of the standard treatment options and, as all rare tumors, sarcoma patients have no access to phase I clinical trials which hampers the identification of new promising compounds. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) prepared by direct engraftment of patient-derived tumor fragments into immunocompromised mice, faithfully recapitulate human tumor biology, elucidate new treatments and biomarkers and predict patient drug response. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are nanometer-sized membrane structures that are massively released by cancer cells and are found in liquid biopsies. Quantification and molecular characterization of EV in liquid biopsies may predict therapy response.Our goal is to improve the overall survival of sarcoma patients and to reduce therapeutic-induced toxicity.",

These vesicles are secreted from all cells, playing a crucial role in intercellular communication and homeostasis, hence participating in processes such as metabolism, growth and development in proximally, or distally, located target cells. Since EVs are able to circulate within the bloodstream, their isolation can be performed in minimally invasive ways, e.g. with a single blood draw - what we call a liquid biopsy. EVs are particularly interesting as they \u00a0provide us with a multi-omics snapshot of the parental cell, by analysing the different EV components. This can be of particular interest in the context of disease and especially in cancer, as tumour derived EVs are known to be involved in cancer progression and metastasis.We hypothesise that by integrating the EV omics information, along with other information retrieved from liquid biopsies (such as cell-free (cf) DNA), we will be able to identify biomarkers for early disease detection and/or patient stratification based on tumour subtype.I am currently working on establishing a protocol to isolate both EV DNA and protein content, as well as cfDNA from a single sample, aiming to maximise efficiency in sample processing and information retrieved, while minimising cost and diagnostic delay.",

Besides its role in immune activation, immune suppression in TDLNs might prevent a durable and effective systemic anti-tumor immune response instead. Understanding the biology of T cells including progenitor T cells in TDLNs, their relationship to tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) and the cellular interactions in both TDLN and tumor microenvironment (TME) that shape their identity is key.Furthermore, we focus on understanding the relationship between type 2 immunity and cancer. Evidence on the role of type 2 inflammation in primary tumor formation is controversial, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not completely understood, and the possible dichotomous functions of stroma and cancer-derived pro-Th2 alarmins and subsequent type 2 effector pathways in tumor immunity in various cancers have yet to be determined. We set out to unravel the complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune cells and the stroma and how this affects the TME and drives tumor formation and shapes the immune response in the TDLN.",

Despite these efforts, participation remains low. Our research tests the efficacy of offering a self-sampling kit (SSK) for HPV testing, facilitated by general practitioners (GPs), as a strategy to boost screening rates.The ESSAG-trial is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with three arms, each comprising 1125 women. In Arm A, GPs offer an SSK during any consultation with eligible women. In Arm B, women receive a GP-signed invitation letter, including an SSK, sent to their home. The control arm continues with the standard invitation letter. The primary outcome is the response rate at three months post-inclusion, while secondary outcomes include screen test positivity, compliance with follow-up among screen-positives, and cost analysis per invited and screened woman.This research is crucial as it explores practical, GP-based interventions to reach underscreened populations, potentially increasing early detection of cervical cancer. By providing insights into effective screening strategies, our findings will help inform policymakers and may lead to region-wide implementation, contributing broadly to multidisciplinary cancer research and public health improvement.",

Despite extensive research efforts aimed at finding cures, the treatment options remain largely inadequate. One of the major reasons for the lack of treatment options is the challenge of drug delivery to the brain which requires crossing of the tightly sealed brain barriers, including the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier at the choroid plexus (ChP). Clearly, there is an urgent need to design novel targeting methods to improve the delivery of therapeutics to the brain (tumor). Single variable domain antibodies or VHHs can be used to target specific receptors at the barriers and consequently exploit the naturally occurring transcytosis mechanisms at the barrier. Recently, the host lab identified a VHH capable of reaching the brain after peripheral injection. To assess the crossing ability of brain targeting VHHs, we currently make use of VHH-neurotensin (NT) peptide fusions. NT induces a measurable hypothermic response upon reaching the hypothalamus. Importantly, this peptide is unable to cross the brain barriers. Consequently, a drop in body temperature after peripheral injections of VHH-NT fusions demonstrates the barrier crossing capacity of the VHH. Recently, we introduced \u00a0ChP organoids to replace the in vivo experiments. These ChP organoids are derived from human pluripotent stem cells and produce a CSF-like fluid contained within a functional barrier of choroid plexus epithelial cells. We aim to employ these organoids to screen for barrier crossing VHHs and to unravel the mechanisms by which they do so.",

After diagnosis of metastases, many patients are treated with systemic therapy such as chemotherapy. Response rates of these therapies are low, and the median survival of sarcoma patients after diagnosis of metastatic disease is only 15 months. Furthermore, many of those therapies cause significant side effects. Concerning the low response rates, this is unfortunate. Since the disease is so rare and heterogenous, personalized treatment is becoming more important.My research focuses on the development of models for sarcoma, including patient-derived xenografts, that can mimic human disease and metastasis.

Historically, researchers have focused on identifying and understanding selection of genetic subclones driving drug resistance. While several mutational mechanisms of drug resistance have been identified, increasing evidence is emerging for the role of non-genetic resistance mechanisms, including epigenetic heterogeneity and plasticity. This evidence poses a new challenge to the field, that requires innovative strategies to monitor these adaptive processes and to identify new treatment options that target these resistance mechanisms and set up more dynamic therapeutic strategies, ultimately leading to better and longer-lasting clinical responses.Implementing these novel therapeutic strategies, however, requires new sensitive and preferably minimally invasive tools. The EpiGuide project will establish a minimally invasive tool to detect and monitor epigenetic biomarkers for therapy resistance of cancer patients. The envisioned EpiGuide assay aims to analyze epigenetic modifications present in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released by tumor cells into the blood plasma and translate this signal into the fractional presence of epigenetic cell states in the tumor through computational deconvolution. In addition to exploring the temporal and spatial dynamics of epigenetic switches in relation to drug resistance and patient outcomes, the long-term objective is to bring the EpiGuide assay into clinical practice and guide personalized and disease state-adapted therapy selection.My main role within the EpiGuide project is to implement, benchmark and improve existing methods for computational deconvolution and explore new strategies to combine different layers of epigenetic information (i.e. methylation, histone modification and nucleosome occupancy patterns) for optimal prediction performance.",

        "research_focus": "Endocrine disrupting compound (EDC) contamination of drinking water has been inevitable since not all EDCs can be eliminated from wastewater, and in-house piping & filter material, as well as packaging (bottled waters) poses additional risks. A full-comprehensive study covering major EDCs (e.g. hormones, industrial chemicals, pesticides), and taking into account cancer risk from a holistic point of view, is non-existent. Currently, international and national drinking water regulation lacks the inclusion of most EDCs, even more for bottled water. EDC exposure is linked to higher cancer risk by disrupting vital hormonal pathways that maintain cellular balance. Scientific evidence underscores the need to minimize contact with these contaminants to reduce the risk of various cancers. The research project AquaGlance is the first to investigate EDCs in bottled & tap drinking water and their exposure-related cancer risks in a Belgian population (the GEZONDHEIDSMONITOR\u00ae), taking into account different geospatial-hydraulic & socio-economic environments, to identify hotspots and vulnerable population groups.The GEZONDHEIDSMONITOR\u00ae is a prospective population study aiming to map the human exposome, and recruiting 20,000 citizens for 20 years. Selected regions were based on Flanders\u2019 representativeness, i.e. data are easily extrapolatable to other regions in Belgium. As a substudy, this research project aims to explore the exposure & cancer risk to EDCs by collecting samples of drinking water, both tap water from 300 households as well as bottled water collected from local supermarkets and drink distributors. To account for different water supply areas related to different tap water suppliers (AquaDuin, AGSO, Water-Link, Farys, Pidpa & de Watergroep), 50 additional samples will be taken, i.e. 10 per water supply area excluding the area already sampled in Ghent. To distuingish for in-home contamination, additional samples will be taken at the water meter (i.e. start of the in-home water distribution) at highly contaminated sites. Comprehensive questionnaires will provide information about water consumption habits and to include vulnerable groups various recruitment strategies will be employed such as translation into 9 languages & involvement of stakeholders from non-profit organizations. Water will be analyzed by (un)targeted high resolution mass spectrometry, having the ability to target confirmed EDCs, as well as perform a retrospective analysis of EDCs under investigation to cover the full-width of EDCs. Most importantly, cancer risk will be assessed using the Risk Quotient method based upon the daily EDC intake, by comparing its exposure levels with established toxicity benchmarks. Relevant risks will be pinpointed in a 3-phase sensibilization and mitigation campaigns. As such, efforts are made to steer current water packaging & treatment technologies focusing on relevant EDCs, inform households about potential risks, and provide practical guidance on how to mitigate exposure in daily life. Lastly, advocating for regulatory changes to reduce EDC presence in drinking water is part of the strategy (translation of scientific results into policy, e.g. funding for water treatment, piping renovation, etc.).Through this collaborative effort, the goal is to sensitize stakeholders from source to tap and work towards practical solutions to minimize the impact of EDCs on cancer development. The results will guide further research on exposure's impact on long-term health, including cancer, throughout the population\u2019s lifetime. This supports continuous campaign improvement based on feedback and emerging insights.",

Prof. Goubert\u2019s team aims to understand how factors like stigma, social support, and family dynamics influence patients' resilience, mental health, and overall quality of life.A core aspect of her work examines family dynamics and how family members\u2019 responses can affect patient coping strategies in both chronic pain and cancer. This includes a dedicated line of research on pain within pediatric cancer, which investigates how children and their parents navigate the pain and stress associated with treatment. These studies analyze parental responses to pain in children with cancer and how family interactions can influence children's emotional resilience, pain perception, and coping mechanisms.In cancer care more broadly, the research extends to understanding family adaptation, communication, and shared coping strategies throughout the illness journey. By recognizing cancer as an experience that profoundly impacts the entire family, this research underscores the importance of family roles and support networks in shaping patient outcomes. Prof. Goubert\u2019s expertise spans both quantitative methodologies (e.g., questionnaires, diaries, vignette methodology) and qualitative approaches (e.g., focus groups, interviews), allowing for a comprehensive exploration of these complex psychosocial factors.",

NB tumour cells accumulate DNA damage and a high level of replicative stress, which can distinguish cancer cells from healthy tissue.Our lab established dependency genes in high-risk NB involved in DNA repair mechanisms and by pharmacologically targeting these characteristics via the ATR kinase axis, we can further increase the replicative stress in the cancer cells and push them to cell death. After extensive in vitro testing of potential therapeutics, toxicity and efficacy must be modelled in vivo to more accurately recapitulate the tumour microenvironment. However, the gold standard of in vivo mouse xenografting is not well suited to compound testing in NB due to the small amount of patient material obtained from thin-needle biopsies and long turn-around time. Zebrafish larvae xenografts have emerged as an attractive alternative for this purpose, with their quick generation time (1 week assay), low amount of patient material required (500-1000 cells per larvae), and relative low-cost amongst other advantages. Additionally, the small size of zebrafish larvae enables high-throughput drug testing in a 96-well plate format. We are developing a zebrafish larvae xenograft platform for high-throughput compound evaluation in NB. After screening compounds for their ability to reduce tumour volume in vivo, we will further characterise their effects with downstream immunohistochemistry, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and phospho-proteomics.This approach is applicable for preclinical drug testing and can be utilised in a personalised medicine platform for NB patients as well as other paediatric cancers.",

Currently, the standard treatments include cytoreductive surgery, intravenous (IV) chemotherapy and/or intraperitoneal (IP) therapeutics. Many patients, however, will have a reoccurrence of disease. Recently, the targeting of the tumor microenvironment (TME) to treat cancers has become a topic of interest. The TME can harbor cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), regulatory T-cells, anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), resulting in an immune environment that enables tumor growth and treatment resistance.In this project, nanoparticles will be formulated with immunomodulatory therapeutics to target the TME to treat PM. The use of immunomodulatory therapeutics is hypothesized to increase the concentration of dendritic cells (DC), natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) within the TME, such that the TME has a more favorable immune phenotype. The formulations will be optimized in vitro and then later evaluated in rat or mice model of peritoneal carcinomatosis following IP drug delivery.",

This phenomenon was termed epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity or EMP. EMP is now being pushed forward as an in vivo causal factor for cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Additionally, EMP promotes cancer stemness and therapy resistance.By combining single cell transcriptomics, spatial tissue analysis, and functional biology, I aim to uncover novel pathways and targets which drive EMP in colorectal cancer. A better understanding of these pathways might reveal new molecular targets and could eventually lead to novel therapies.",

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection particularly high-risk (HR) strains like 16 and 18, is the primary driver of cervical cancer development, although not all HR-HPV infections lead to malignancy. Both vaccination against HPV and screening methods have significantly reduced mortality rates. Currently, screening methods rely on cytology based approaches which are dependent on the expertise of trained cytopathologists. Recently, there has been a shift towards the detection of HPV-DNA, however, this approach can lead to false positives due to transient infections.The European ELEVATE and CHILI projects aim to develop a point of care tool that can assist in cervical cancer screening, combining detection of HPV DNA with that of specific cervical cancer biomarkers. The tool uses lab-on-a-chip technology and is compatible with self-sampling.My work focuses primarily on the detection of biomarkers (p16 and ki67) and can be divided into three main work packages. In the first place, a correlation between the biomarker profile and lesion grade must be established. Second, antibodies against these biomarkers must be screened for efficient binding properties, resulting in a highly sensitive and specific assay. Third, the antibodies must be adsorbed or covalently bound to the electrodes in our lab-on-a-chip and an appropriate assay must be developed.",

More recently, we have also successfully optimized and implemented rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS)-based methodologies (Plekhova et al., 2021) for multiple biofluids, moving metabolomics from bench to bedside by e.g. eliminating the need for extensive sample preparation. The application of the above-mentioned methodologies for the discovery of reliable and robust biomarkers to enable early diagnosis, screening, surveillance, and primary prevention of the disease, through e.g. dietary recommendations, belongs to LIMET\u2019s current research objectives.",

Some key issues in the management of these patients are (micro)metastatic disease control, and predicting response to systemic therapies. Utilising and mapping molecular tumour cell biology and physiology, histopathological tests and metabolic imaging (such as positron emission tomography with radiotracers) help in identifying and stratifying patients accordingly, yet, to date, lack the required sensitivity and specificity to do so accurately. My clinical research is mainly focused on the evaluation and optimisation of established and novel radiotracers in nuclear medicine for diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic management of patients with relapsed or metastatic carcinoma of thyroid or head and neck. Additionally, I am involved in preclinical evaluation of the use of radiopharmaceuticals for systemic radiation therapy as novel treatment option in murine models for head and neck and thyroid cancer.",

When fluorescent contrast agents can successfully identify malignant cells in dogs with cancer, it is likely that these agents will succeed in clinical trials in human patients with a similar tumour type, possibly reducing the need for adjuvant therapy and associated morbidity, and to increasing survival time.",

BRIP1 is located on 17q and highly expressed in aggressive NBs. BRIP1 has been proposed as a master regulator of replication fork dynamics. I\u2019m performing BRIP1 perturbation experiments in vitro to study the impact of BRIP1 on the cellular NB phenotype. In addition, I am making use of MYCN and BRIP1 stable overexpressing zebrafish lines to study the impact of BRIP1 on MYCN driven NB tumor initiation and maintenance. Furthermore, I will perform structure-function analyses to determine which functionalities of BRIP1 are important for tumor dependency. Finally, potential new interesting domains in BRIP1 will be identified as well. This will ultimately lead to novel insights into BRIP1 function, which may contribute to novel targeted therapies.",

First symptoms are usually non-specific, and as a result ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Despite a good response to the first-line treatment, approximately 80% of patients will relapse in the first five years. As such, there is a high unmet clinical need for new therapeutic strategies to improve the outcome of these patients. \u00a0In the past, bacterial L-asparaginases have been shown to be effective in 15 - 25% of ovarian cancers. However, the used formulations were poorly tolerated in patients after which further investigation for the use of asparaginases in advanced ovarian cancer was terminated.We have generated an alternative mammalian-derived L-asparaginase variant, which has a significantly improved safety and toxicity profile compared to the standard-of-care bacterial L-asparaginases. Through biomarker analysis, we want to characterize the subgroup of ovarian cancer patients that are sensitive to asparaginase therapy. A variety of preclinical patient-derived models will then be used to evaluate the efficacy of this alternative variant, both ex vivo and in vivo. Altogether, with this new asparaginase variant, we hope to revive clinical trials and eventually provide extra therapeutic opportunities for ovarian cancer patients.",

In this disease, we study the non-coding RNA transcriptome, with a focus on lncRNAs and circRNAs, which have recently been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including hematopoiesis. These non-coding RNAs have received much research attention as they possess features interesting for treatment, such as tissue specificity, low overall expression and easy targetability with RNAi or gene editing technology. We aim at deciphering the lncRNA and circRNA transcriptome of JMML and use this knowledge to develop novel treatments.Besides, I am also working on various other pediatric cancer types i.e. pre-B ALL and AML. Our research key areas within the specific focus include: i) preclinical evaluation of new treatments; ii) establishing strategies to develop highly specific personalized drug therapies, and iii) actively participating to a diverse array of clinical trials.Our studies are carried out by employing genome-wide screening techniques at the DNA level (array CGH, whole exome and candidate gene DNA sequencing) and at the RNA level (gene expression and microRNA profiling). In addition, we have extensive experience with many molecular biology tools for functional analyses.Importantly, the optimal translation of the fundamental and applied research into children benefit (short-and long-term) is a major aspect throughout all our research lines.",

Although they have a relatively benign course, keratinocyte skin cancers have a high morbidity and economic burden. Since their prevalence and cost is predicted to triple in the next decades, an evidence-based management approach is highly needed. Dermatologist-led screening of the population for KC is considered not to be cost-effective.With our current FWO research project we want to map the exact impact of KC on the patient\u2019s quality of life, and characterize the natural behaviour of basal cell carcinomas using in vivo state of the art imaging techniques (confocal microscopy and high-definition optical coherence tomography). The clinical trials will allow to implement more cost-effective treatment procedures and follow-up regimens for our patients in daily practice, especially in patients with a limited life expectancy.In addition, our group is interested in the development and clinical validation of imaging devices (such as infrared thermography) for early diagnosis of skin cancer, and working on artificial intelligence for skin cancer diagnostics. In a multidisciplinary collaboration with the group ofProf. Jimmy Van den Eynden, we are studying the clonal and tumoural spatial interdependency in squamous cell skin cancer.",

The long-term follow-up, however, does show increased cardiac morbidity and mortality. The risk of heart disease is greatest in patients receiving a higher heart dosage i.e., left sided breast cancer and irradiation of the internal mammary lymph nodes and does not appear to have a threshold. Lowering heart dose can be achieved by improved planning methods as well as increasing the distance between the target volume and the heart. A deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) is often used to this end.An unassisted DIBH is between 12 and 30 seconds; a simple breast irradiation averages 4 DIBHS for completion. More advanced radiotherapy plans (including lymph nodes) needs up to 20 DIBHs. This great amount can be both physically and mentally exhausting.The focus of my research is to increase the DIBH-times so they could be used in clinical practice whilst keeping the preparation short and simple and lower patient stress and discomfort.",

CHWs are instrumental in empowering underscreened women with the necessary health skills and knowledge to make informed choices regarding their participation in breast cancer screening. My research contributes to the growing body of literature on the effectiveness of community-based interventions in addressing healthcare disparities.

In addition, I am to investigate and identify distinct bacterial taxa driving CRC, using state-of-the-art germfree and gnotobiotic mouse technology.It has become increasingly clear that the gut microbiota is a central regulator of health and disease, affects both cancer development and therapy response.

Fluorescence-guided surgery is a technique which may aid the surgeon in real-time by lighting up the cancerous tissue during surgery. However, during conventional fluorescence-guided surgery, only the light intensity itself is being measured and false positive results due to scattering in surrounding tissue may take place. My current research focuses on the timescale behavior of the fluorescence light (i.e., the fluorescence lifetime or FLT) as a different but complementary part of fluorescence-guided surgery. The FLT resembles the duration of the excitation state of the molecule, which is injected prior to surgery to light up the cancerous tissue. The FLT will change depending on alterations in the environment (e.g., the oxygen concentration or pH). This could be of great importance in guiding the surgeon during various procedures. The first part of my research will focus on the use of FLT to measure the oxygen levels in tissue by using an experimental partial nephrectomy model in pigs. Furthermore, I will assess whether the FLT is able to accurately differentiate between tumor fluorescence and non-specific and healthy-tissue fluorescence during surgery in client-owned dogs with solid cancer. In addition, my research focuses on the added value of the FLT when used in combination with nanobody tracers. The outcome of this research will not only be important for veterinary surgical oncology, but it will also have translational value.",

By safeguarding the balance between immunity and tolerance, dendritic cells play a pivotal role in the anti-tumor immune response by orchestrating how our immune system will react to the tumor. As antigen presenting cells, they continuously patrol the environment for antigens, also in the tumor microenvironment where they take up dying tumor cells. Once they have taken up an antigen, they mature, migrate to the T cells in the lymph nodes and present the antigens. Depending on how dendritic cells perceive the antigen at the time of uptake, -as dangerous or as self-, they will instruct our adaptive immune system to kill or tolerate the tumor. This will lead to tumor rejection or tumor growth, respectively. How dendritic cells decode tumor antigens and what determines the balance between immunity and tolerance remains poorly understood. Our lab addresses how the uptake of dying cells induces tolerogenic versus immunogenic dendritic cell maturation. We recently uncovered a key role for cholesterol metabolic pathways at this decision point. As a proof of concept, we found approaches to affect the maturation of DCs (amongst others) in the tumor by targeting them in vivo with modified lipid nanoparticles, resulting in immunogenic presentation of tumor antigens. Future studies in my lab aim to unravel what defines the type of dendritic cell maturation within the tumor microenvironment and how we can manipulate this to enforce tumor rejection.",

Although treatment in other groups of cancer are evolving, treatment options for sarcoma have remained essentially unchanged over the past 3 decades despite attempts to improve outcome. The overall 5 year survival rate is between 65-75%. With metastatic disease, it will decrease below 30%. Therefore it is necessary to explore and to identify novel therapeutic strategies for pediatric sarcomas to improve the overall survival.In this PhD, I will focus more on the Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI), that represent the largest class of targeted therapies, with multiple inhibitors already approved for treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. This project aims to generate in vivo pediatric patient avatars to select the TKI with the most effective therapy response and to prevent TKI therapy resistance by selection of synergistic drugs.The ultimate goal is to offer contemporary treatment for these patients by building a patient avatar from their tumor to test novel treatment approaches with the potential for direct clinical translation and implementation in pediatric cancer patients.",

Previous research did identify several genomic drivers of drug resistance and therapy failure (e.g. mutations, copy number variations). However, more recent research also showed the involvement of non-genetic mechanisms such as epigenetic heterogeneity/plasticity that are linked to cell state switches and escaping therapeutic pressure. Longitudinal monitoring these epigenetic alterations is a challenge that needs to be tackled in order to allow in time detection of therapy resistance. Therefore, in the EpiGuide project, we aim to develop a minimal-invasive assay to monitor epigenetic switches that drive drug resistance in patients.The envisioned EpiGuide assay measures different epigenetic data layers from circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) shedded by tumor cells into the blood plasma and translates this signal into the fractional presence of epigenetic cell states in the tumor through computational deconvolution. Additionally, we aim to generate epigenomic atlases of the tumors by implementing and developing innovative single-cell and spatial epigenomic methods. Next to studying the temporal and spatial dynamics of epigenetic cell state switches in relation to drug resistance and patient outcome, the long-term goal is to bring the EpiGuide assay into clinical practice and guide personalized and disease state-adapted therapy selection.",

The incorporation of this diagnostic modality enables us to evaluate these materials in vivo, enhancing our comprehension of the developed systems and thus accelerating their research. In addition to cancer treatment research, we are implementing stimuli responsive materials for control drug release, and developing novel in vitro and in vivo cancer models, to be able to test our drug delivery systems.",

Pegaspargase is an effective agent for feline lymphoma. Its incorporation into a COP chemotherapy protocol may confer a survival benefit, especially in cats with complete responses to pegaspargase. Treatment appears generally well tolerated, compared to humans. Further studies are required to assess the benefits of pegaspargase as monotherapy or as part of different multi-agent chemotherapy regimens. Pegaspargase can be a valuable alternative for pets not allowed to receive chemotherapy. Dogs and cats can also be valuable animal models for further research and development of new asparaginases, the drug, which is a cornerstone of the successful treatment of ALL and certain non-Hodgkin/LBL in humans. Owing to therapeutic limitations and the toxicity spectrum in humans, there is an ongoing need for further development of less toxic and safer versions of asparaginase for human patients, where dogs can greatly contribute to the research due to the spontaneous occurrence of their disease as well as the shared environment and societal status that allows them to be treated as \u201cpatients,\u201d while at the same time being able to ethically explore translational innovations.

Most of these tumors are considered rare diseases and are therefore relatively understudied. Unfortunately, this results in suboptimal treatment options for many of these patients. With our endocrine tumor research group, we want to focus on the following aspects of endocrine oncology:- Improving follow-up and care for patients with iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma. This subgroup of patients presents with or develops dedifferentiated thyroid cancer which is associated with a worse prognosis. Due to loss of expression of the Na/I symporter necessary to apply radioactive iodine imaging and treatment, optimal management and therapy is hampered. Using novel imaging techniques such as 18F-PSMA-11 PET/CT but also by trying to detect more reliable tumor markers (e.g. PSMA serum levels, circulating tumor cells) we want to contribute to better patient management, and maybe even improve therapeutic options. In addition, we want to investigate causative pathophysiologic mechanisms for this dedifferentiation process.- Management of hereditary endocrine tumor syndromes. Germline mutations in different genes (e.g. menin, PPKAR1A, SDHx, RET, \u2026) are associated with an increased risk to develop different endocrine tumors. Still, there is uncertainty with respect to optimal screening protocols and genetic counseling in these subjects. Our research focusses on further deciphering possible geno-/phenotype correlations and balancing risks and benefits of screening in these entities. In addition, future work will focus on evaluating early disease markers (e.g. tumor mRNA, circulating tumor cells, \u2026).",

The surgical research line focuses on ameliorating the outcome after limb salvage surgery including tumor resection and reconstruction of the bone defect. The reconstruction can be performed either in a biological (bone grafts) or a non-biological (reconstruction prosthesis) way. Each technique has its indications, best practices and pitfalls. Improving the patient\u2019s function and avoiding complications and re-operations by optimising surgical techniques are important in the clinical setting. The non-surgical research line is divided in two parts. One part involves the exploration of the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the development of lung metastases in sarcoma patients. EVs are released by different cell types including cancer cells. They play a role in the progression of cancer by exchanging 'messages' from cancer cells to target cells locally and at a distance via the bloodstream. The role of EVs in the progression of sarcoma patients and more specifically the formation of lung metastases is largely unravelled. The other part of our non-surgical research line is focused on further elaboration of our in-house developed chick chorio-allantoic membrane assay (CAM-assay) to develop a faithful and representative preclinical sarcoma model to test standard and experimental compounds. For this, we will perform a co-clinical trial with accepted (but time-consuming) models in literature such as patient-derived (orthotopic) xenografts (PD(o)X) to validate our CAM-assay to deliver relevant therapeutic answers in a time window of 14 days and provide a quick access to effective treatments.",

Our primary objective is to unveil novel therapeutic targets for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and gut-driven brain disorders, such as fatigue and Parkinson's disease.A significant concern within the realm of IBD, particularly in patients with colitis, is the development of colitis-associated cancer (CAC). This form of cancer is distinct from sporadic colorectal cancer, as it is primarily driven by chronic inflammation. Despite advancements in inflammation management, endoscopic detection, and resection techniques, CAC risk remains significantly elevated in IBD patients compared to the general population, even when the patients have achieved remission. This underscores the urgent need to enhance our understanding of the transition from inflammation to cancer progression, enabling us to identify at-risk patients and develop innovative preventive and therapeutic strategies.One of our research lines focuses on dissecting and manipulating the communication pathways between epithelial (tumor) cells and fibroblast subtypes that promote cancer development within an inflammatory context. To accomplish this, we employ a range of tools and techniques, including (endoscopy-guided) mouse models of colon cancer, gut organoids, and preclinical validation using CAC samples.",

Perturbations in the cellular and molecular dialogue between these cells are underlying multiple dermatological diseases, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and skin cancer.My research project aims to identify crucial keratinocyte-immune interactions in autoinflammation and investigate their functional relevance in the skin. Furthermore, I assess how molecular signaling between immune cells and keratinocytes affects epidermal stem cell migration and proliferation.

Within diagnostic applications, a major role is played by nanoparticle imaging techniques like magnetic particle imaging (MPI), Magnetorelaxometry imaging and AC-Susceptibility imaging. Concerning therapeutic applications, the particles often act as drug carriers. Another promising emerging adjuvant cancer therapy is magnetic particle hyperthermia, which exploits the increased heat sensitivity of cancer cells as compared to healthy tissues by bringing the particles in close contact with tumorous tissue and subsequently exposing them to a magnetic radiofrequency (RF) field. This causes the particles' magnetization to run through a dissipative hysteresis loop, thereby heating the surrounding tissue, and triggering cell death.In order to operate efficiently, these applications pose specific requirements on the nanoparticles. Therefore, improving our insight in the relation between the structure and magnetic properties of these particles will allow for the guided synthesis of particles with optimal properties for each application.In our group at the department of solid state sciences, we perform both theoretical/numerical and experimental research in this direction:Advanced (micromagnetic) modeling approaches that simulate the dynamics of the particles, in equilibrium or in response to externally applied magnetic excitations. Specifically, we try to gain a deeper insight in the underlying physical processes describing particle heating in hyperthermia.Experimental characterization of the particles (coming soon in our lab: AC-susceptometry, MOKE microscopy) or in collaboration with other labs (PTB, Berlin, Germany): magnetorelaxometry, thermal noise magnetometry,...",

Hence, more effective and less toxic treatments are highly required.My PhD focusses on novel drugging approaches for MYCN-driven NB. To this end, I will first characterize the MYCN-driven NB zebrafish model. Then, I will use this gained knowledge to test the effect of ATR-CHK1 targeting drugs on MYCN-driven NB in the zebrafish model. In parallel, I will validate the ATR-CHK1 targeting drugs on zebrafish larvae, xenografted with human NB cell lines.Next to this, I will study the ribonucleotide reductase subunit 2 (RRM2). This gene was recently identified as novel dependency gene in NB by the PPOL research team. Using the dTAG approach, which allows specifically and reversibly target protein degradation, I will degrade RRM2 in the MYCN-driven NB zebrafish model. In this way, I aim to validate RRM2 as a target for combinatorial drugging of MYCN-driven NB.",

Within the thymic microenvironment, these thymus-seeding progenitors (TSPs) interact with distinct types of stromal cells that drive their stepwise maturation into immune competent T cells. Taghon\u2019s lab identified two distinct subsets of TSPs. While TSP1s were predicted to exclusively generate T cells, TSP2s could potentially generate dendritic cells (DCs). I discovered that \u00a0these DC-biased TSP2s express the membrane-bound precursor form of the cytokine TNF (tmTNF) to promote differentiation of TSPs into T cell precursors through activation of the TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) instead of TNFR1.In vitro recapitulation of TNFR2 signaling by providing low-density tmTNF or a selective TNFR2 agonist enhanced the generation of developmentally competent human T cell precursors. Thus, I provide proof of concept that selective targeting of TNFR2 can enhance the in vitro generation of T cell precursors and competent T cells for cell therapy.The discovery laid the scientific foundation for NOVISTEM project which was granted by the European Innovation Council in 2022. In this project, we aim to selectively target TNFR2 to improve T cell maturation and CAR T-cell production from human induced pluripotent stem cells.",

ESCC is the dominant histological form, accounting for more than 90% of all EC cases globally. ESCC shows a sharp geographical dispersion with the highest incidence rates in regions stretching along eastern Africa, 'the African EC Belt' and Central Asia, 'the Asia EC corridor'. Alcohol and tobacco are the well-known ESCC risk factors, while hot beverages, mycotoxins, poor diet, and oral hygiene are putative risk factors. While DNA damage is essential in cancer development, the link between external insults and internal injury is not well illustrated. DNA adducts, the covalent modifications of DNA, are important biomarkers of exposure and an essential mode of action in cancer development. Considering the vital contribution of external vulnerabilities and their equivalent biological responses (in the form of DNA adducts), we primarily seek to establish the association between environmental and lifestyle exposures with DNA adduct predisposition among individuals residing in low and high ESCC incidence regions. We envisage that such data would be relevant in quantifying individual risks associated with external ESCC factors, consequently informing prevention and control strategies at both individual and policy levels.",

The accumulation of multi-omics data allows to investigate this crosstalk across multiple regulatory layers in the cell. The identification of regulatory metabolites and regulatory factors might open new avenues for biomarkers and therapeutics in precision medicine. Also epigenetic information e.g. open chromatin measured with ATAC-seq or methylation patterns provide additional insights and integration with expression data have shown to boost the precision of regulatory network inference. However, multi-omics data integration is still challenging, and available methods have not been comprehensively evaluated so far.Our goal is to conduct a benchmarking of methods for multi-omics data integration that will provide context-specific guidelines for best practices in the field and allow to discover individual strength, weaknesses and potential synergies of multi-omics network inference methods. Based on our comparison, using an ensemble or composite approach or an optimization of an existing method, we aim to develop an improved methodology for multi-omics data integration in the context of regulatory networks to provide biomarker signatures and in-depth mechanistic understanding of complex diseases.Finally, we will apply our methodology to data of neuro-inflammatory disorders and cancer to identify regulatory factors and their molecular interactions. An increased understanding of the interplay between transcriptome, epigenome and metabolome at a systems level will lead to opportunities for diagnostics, prognostics, therapeutics and prevention in these complex diseases.",

There is an unmet need for alternative solutions, as therapeutic advances have\u00a0been marginal over the past decades. The lack of effective treatments is due to tumor\u00a0heterogeneity, the complex tumor microenvironment and the blood-brain barrier. Drug\u00a0repurposing offers the advantage to use commercially available compounds with known\u00a0safety profiles, while simultaneously unravelling molecular pathways involved in the\u00a0progression of complex diseases, such as GB. Moreover, attacking the tumor from different\u00a0angles with brain-penetrant drugs by acting on different growth related pathways can be\u00a0much more effective, both in eliciting damage to the tumor cells as well as prohibiting the\u00a0development of individual drug resistance. In addition, standard of care can also be made\u00a0more effective.The goal of my research is to evaluate the potential of drug repurposing regimens in GB. This\u00a0will be investigated using animal models of GB, as well as patient samples, which will be\u00a0obtained in close collaboration with UZ Gent and KU Leuven. The outcome might be of\u00a0tremendous benefit for GB patients, since repurposed drugs may be implemented into the\u00a0clinic much faster, compared to investigational new drugs, because of their known safety\u00a0profiles. In addition, the established preclinical models might be used to evaluate future\u00a0repurposed regimens, as well as chemical entities.",

Our research contributes to the development of better vaccines and aims to understand the molecular basis of autoimmune disease.Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and in order to replicate they need to deliver their RNA and DNA genomes inside the host cell. The cells that make up our body contain sensory molecules called nucleic acid receptors which detect virally derived nucleic acids. Different types of nucleic acid receptors activate distinct antiviral defence mechanisms which cooperate to clear the viral pathogen. Some receptors respond to infection by releasing antiviral molecules, which alert surrounding cells of the ensuing viral attack. Others instruct the infected cell to commit suicide thereby preventing viral dissemination.Our research focuses on the identification of the precise molecular signatures that activate nucleic acid receptors and how viruses fight back by blocking the molecular signalling pathways that are activated upon infection.In another aspect of our research we try to understand how nucleic acid receptors specifically recognise viral nucleic acids and avoid contact with cellular RNA and DNA. Healthy uninfected cells are packed with endogenous RNA and DNA molecules which are important for normal cell function. Unwanted detection of these nucleic acids can result in detrimental immune responses, including the development of autoimmunity.",

Chemotherapy has long been a primary treatment strategy, targeting rapidly dividing cancer cells. However, traditional chemotherapeutic agents often cause significant side effects due to their impact on healthy cells. Recent research has shifted towards exploring bioactive natural compounds as potential adjuncts or alternatives to conventional therapies. Among these, curcumin, a compound derived from turmeric (C. longa), has demonstrated considerable anticancer potential by modulating multiple cellular pathways involved in cancer progression. Despite its promise, curcumin's clinical application is limited by poor bioavailability, chemical instability, and nonspecific interactions (classifying it as a pan-assay interference compound, PAINS), necessitating the development of more effective derivatives.This research investigates the potential of curcumin-inspired benzothiazepane derivatives as novel anticancer agents, aiming to address the limitations of curcumin. Building on previous findings, this work focuses on the synthesis and biological evaluation of a library of benzothiazepane analogs. Their cytotoxicity will be assessed across various cancer cell lines, with the aim to establish a structure-activity relationship (SAR) to identify key structural elements that enhance anticancer activity. By comparing these new compounds with established chemotherapy drugs, this research seeks to advance the development of benzothiazepane-based therapeutics with improved efficacy and clinical potential.",

Moreover, in Europe, it accounts for 21% of the cancer-related deaths, representing a major health problem. In the last few years, immunotherapy has become a very promising option for lung cancer treatment, more specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). These monoclonal antibodies enhance the immune anti-tumoral T-cell responses by blocking CTLA4 or PD-1/PDL1 interactions, which are immune suppressive pathways expressed in the tumor microenvironment to dampen those responses. Clinical trials show a response rate between 20% and 28% for nivolumab and pembrolizumab (both approved PD-1 inhibitors), which is more than with chemotherapy. In addition, immunotherapy is less toxic than chemotherapy, yet adverse effects can happen.Given its high cost and potential toxicities, and therefore its major impact on both the patients and the health care system, \u00a0an important clinical challenge is to identify immunotherapy responders upfront and monitor the responses after the first weeks of treatment. Several biomarkers for immunotherapy response have been studied, but none of them have the accuracy to completely distinguish responders from non-responders. In addition, all of them need the collection of a tumor tissue biopsy.Therefore, the main aim of this research project is to develop and implement a clinically affordable and usable predictive test for ICI-therapy response, which can be performed in the patients\u2019 blood before and after the first administration of the treatment. To achieve this goal, I will perform RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing in whole blood and PBMC samples from responsive and non-responsive patients to ICI-therapy, and apply a computational deconvolution pipeline on the generated data to identify immune cell subpopulations that are differentially present in both groups.",

The exposome is defined as the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan including exposures from the environment, diet, behaviour and endogenous processes.FLEXiGUT is the first large-scale exposomics study focused on chronic low-grade gut inflammation and related biological processes and diseases, including gastrointestinal cancers. Two Flemish prospective cohorts are used to cover the human life course: the \u201cENVIRONAGE birth cohort\u201d, a mother-child cohort from gestation to the age of 10 years, and the \u201cFlemish Gut Flora Project longitudinal cohort\u201d, a cohort of adults. To be able to answer the scientific questions of the project, it has been calculated that a sample size of 400 individuals is required for each cohort.Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by fungi when growing on crops used for human and animal consumption. Mycotoxins are significant to cancer research because long-term exposure can cause toxic effects such as genetic changes in target organs, resulting in cancer. For example, Aflatoxin B1 is known to covalently bind to DNA. The formation of these DNA adducts can lead to mutations and chemically-induced carcinogenesis. Mycotoxin biomarkers and metabolites in urine and blood will be analysed by LC-MS/MS. DNA adductomics will provide a direct reflection of the genotoxin exposure, effects and disease risk.To link the exposures and the health outcomes, the integration of multiple types of -omics datasets, that is, multi-omics will give opportunities for finding correlations between features, developing classifier and predictive models, discovering biomarkers and elucidate early molecular events in the pathways leading to cancer.",

Unfortunately, in up to 20% of breast cancer patients, pathological assessment of the resected breast cancer specimen indicates that the tumor removal was incomplete. As pathology takes several days, these patients must undergo repeated surgery to remove remaining tumor cells. Recently, micro-PET-CT imaging of resected breast cancer specimens emerged as a promising technique for fast intraoperative visualization and verification of the resection margins. This technique requires preoperative administration of the radiotracer 18F-FDG to the patient. As 18F-FDG may show nonspecific uptake in metabolically active benign tissue, like inflamed tissue, interpreting micro-PET-CT images can be challenging in some cases. Hence, we are developing a decision-support system that can aid physicians to interpret micro-PET-CT images of resected breast cancer specimens. To reach this goal, we are developing techniques to co-register micro-PET-CT specimen images with the corresponding ground truth whole-slide histopathology images. These co-registered images provide insight into the radiotracer uptake patterns of different breast tissue types. In addition, we use these co-registered images to develop a deep learning model that can automatically segment breast tumors in micro-PET-CT images of resected breast cancer specimens. We hope that this technology will allow physicians to treat patients with more confidence and will avoid re-surgeries.",

While CITs greatly improve standard of care, many cancers exhibit low responses rates. This is particularly the case for lung cancers. Identifying novel targets to enhance response rates, avoid T-cell exhaustion or even to render unresponsive tumors sensitive to these treatments could significantly increase the number of patients subjectable to these game-changing therapies. Pathways leading to such heterogeneous treatment response remain incompletely charted. While lncRNAs have been demonstrated to act as transcription regulators, their involvement in T-cell activation or immune evasion has poorly if not been investigated. Given the need to enhance the reach of immune therapy into less responsive cases, we aim to systematically identify lncRNAs capable of modulating CIT response in lung cancer. Our hypothesis is that lncRNAs constitute an important, untapped and very convenient pool of targets to enhance immunotherapy response using ASO-based therapies.",

Therefore, a part of this PhD research is focusing on assessing the impact of KC on HRQoL. Moreover, due to its high incidence, increasing healthcare costs and high levels of services used to manage skin cancer, a significant economic burden on society is imposed. Insights into the cost of skin cancer can provide a guidance and resource for policy development, priority setting and management of pubic health.

These are fibroblastic skin tumors induced by the bovine papillomavirus and can have different clinical presentations. Although they do no metastasize they show local signs of malignancy and due to their potential for recidivism they can form a real therapeutical challenge.Our research focuses on finding new treatment options by exploring the virus host interactions and the immune-evasive character of the sarcoid. We are currently exploring ways to apply gene-modifying techniques such as CRISPR/Cas in order to eliminate viral oncogenes inside sarcoid cells.Another research line focuses on the cellular micro-environment within the sarcoid. Here we aim to find new insights into the interaction between the host immune system and the tumor. We strive to find new, potential therapeutical markers within the equine sarcoid.",

The healthy organs that could be potentially damaged after the treatment can then be mapped without the need to already administer a therapeutic radioisotope. In this way, a personalized safe treatment can be developed for each patient.The secondary goal of my project is to evaluate and compare the efficacy and toxicity of radiopharmaceuticals emitting different types of radiation in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma in murine models. This may help in the future to improve the quality of life for people diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma and possibly also for other epithelial tumors.",

In response to these poor survival rates, the therapeutic focus has recently shifted towards a personalized approach with the development of cancer vaccines targeting neoepitopes. In this approach, the immune system is actively stimulated to recognize and attack tumor cells, while simultaneously establishing immunological memory for continuous tumor suppression.The neoepitopes, targeted by cancer vaccines, are highly tumor-specific antigens stemming from somatic mutations that arose during the developmental process of the tumor. Currently, neoepitopes are selected for each patient based on genetic heterogeneity, incorporating only those expressed by the majority of cancer cells into the vaccine design. However, this approach is not sensitive enough to detect small subpopulations of highly proliferative or metastatic cells that can induce relapse.My PhD project aims to optimize neoepitope vaccines by integrating both genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity into their design, which will allow us to zoom in on harder-to-eliminate subpopulations. To achieve this, we perform full-length single-cell RNA sequencing (Smartseq3express), as it can identify and characterize genetic and transcriptionally distinct subpopulations. With this approach, our goal is to incorporate, alongside tumor-wide neoepitopes, also neoepitopes targeting specific subpopulations into the vaccine design, enhancing its effectiveness and mediating long-term remission.",

Chronic intakes of multiple mycotoxins are hypothesized to interact with oncogenic viruses enhancing the risk of developing several carcinomas. Oncogenic viruses play an important role in a number of cancers that are endemic to Africa. For example, infection by Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is linked to a form of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma (eBL) that is endemic in parts of Africa forming the so-called lymphoma belt. Chronic mycotoxin exposure and EBV viral infection are highly prevalent in those areas, indicating a level of interaction to the development of eBL.Understanding the mechanisms by which mycotoxins and viruses interact to induce tumors, elucidates the risk they pose to public health and provides key information to the scientific community as well as to regulatory authorities.",

As the name indicates, this consortium was set up to support the translation of new research findings in the field of paediatric oncology to new therapeutic options, making science find its way to children in need of new and better treatments.In specific, the consortium will help bridge the gap between basic and clinical research through stimulating close collaborations and supporting biobanking efforts. Therefor I write and bring in to (clinical) practice practical flows for the biobanking of human body material for (inter)national academic clinical studies and general research, as well as support the set-up of a national pediatric-specific biobank collection. The access to patient material via this biobanking effort is crucial for the translation of (basic) research findings to the clinic, and is of utmost importance for the development and selection of the best fit treatment for each patient, the focus of personalized medicine.Thanks to the support of the Olivia Fund, I was appointed as coordinator of this consortium, under the direct supervision of paediatric oncologistProf. Dr. Bram De Wilde(UZ Gent, CRIG), Prof. Dr. Catherine Van Der Straeten (HIRUZ UZ Gent), andProf. Dr. Tim Lammens(UGent, CRIG).To ensure all (Belgian) patients benefit from the initiative, the TEARDRoP consortium has a close partnership with the \u2018Belgian Society of Pediatric Haematology Oncology (BSPHO)\u2019, an organization that has been supporting academic research into children\u2019s cancer for years.",

Seventy percent of them receive treatment with curative intent, consisting of surgery and/or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy depending on the stage of the disease.

Cervical cancer survivors frequently experience long-term consequences of the treatment of which sexual dysfunction is often \u201cforgotten\u201d.I am investigating the sexual consequences of treatment in cervical cancer survivors with 3 research projects:1/ VAMOS trial: Impact of vaginal morbidity on sexual functioning in cervical cancer patients treated with curative intent. This trial is recruiting since 07/2019 and included already more than 130 patients. This trial uses patient-reported outcomes (ie standardized questionnaires).2/ SEBA trial: Evaluation of implementation of the sexologist in the care path for cervical cancer patients treated with curative intent. This trial is recruiting since 05/2021.3/ KWALI trial: Impact of treatment on sexual functioning in cervical cancer patients treated with curative intent: a qualitative data collection based on semi-structured interviews from the patient\u2019s and physician\u2019s point of view. We aim to interview 15 cervical cancer survivors and 15 physicians subspecialized in gynecological oncology working in 5 Flemish hospitals.The final goal of these 3 projects is to achieve a complete image of the current situation regarding sexuality in cervical cancer survivors and to translate the results into better patient care.",

Classically, the focus has been on the inhibition of kinases or kinase receptors, which have enzymatic activities that drive cellular signaling cascades. However, the clinical efficacy of the currently existing targeted therapies leaves room for improvement, especially to overcome the occurrence of resistance, which requires novel approaches. One such strategy that holds great promise is targeted protein degradation (TPD), in which a protein of interest is to be eliminated by the cellular proteolytic system. This would allow to also target the non-enzymatic cancer-driving activities of proteins, expanding the druggable proteome and possibly leading to stronger therapeutic effects. Therefore, we are working on the development of a novel platform for targeted protein degradation that will be evaluated in the context of a range of cancer-associated proteins.",

Anti-cancer therapy is more successful when an immunogenic form of cell death is induced, which in turn can activate an immune response specific to cancer cells. In this regard, immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a novel exploitable paradigm for anti-cancer therapy. ICD combines the ability to both kill cancer cells and simultaneously activate anti-tumor immunity. Particularly important in the operation of ICD is the well-balanced load of the recognition of antigenic structures (antigenicity) and the spatiotemporal emission of immune-modulatory mediators (adjuvanticity), including the emission of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs, such as ATP, HMGB1, calreticulin) and/or various pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines from the dying cancer cells.The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of a heterogeneous set of ostensibly normal cells that may positively or negatively affect the outcome of ICD. The aim of my project is to further explore the immune-modulatory role of ICD-induced cancer cells, and to gain detailed insights into the reciprocal interaction between ICD and the TME in vitro and in vivo.",

HUMYCO refers to a unique, holistic & multi(cross)-disciplinary research field, aiming at comprehensively investigating the human mycobolome through uniting large-scale epidemiological & mechanistic designs using a poly-omic approach. Focus is set to generate newly hypotheses-driven insights into the role of multiple mycotoxin exposure in the aetiology of human carcinomas. The capability of conducting accurate exposure assessments of mycotoxins at the individual-level is required to fully understand the potential health consequences in humans, therefore, mycotoxin biomarkers of exposure will be primarily identified in vitro, and validated using human intervention studies by elucidating human mycotoxicokinetic profiles via metabolomics.The nature and extent of associations between estimated external and internal dietary multiple mycotoxin exposures and developing renal, colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas will be investigated through large-scale epidemiological bio-cohorts, established in both Europe and Africa. To further disentangle possible associative mycotoxin-induced cancer development, causal relations will be verified through an innovative mechanistic arm applying advanced cutting-edged technologies. For the first time, genome-wide mutation spectra associated with multi-exposure to putatively carcinogenic mycotoxins will be experimentally determined.

In addition, metals can be\u00a0used as tags that can help identify different cell types and even subcellular structures.\u00a0Monitoring the metal content in cells is therefore of the utmost importance as it can give us\u00a0crucial information about cells in both health and disease.My research focuses on fundamental and applied aspects of single-cell inductively coupled\u00a0plasma-mass spectrometry (SC-ICP-MS), a technique that recently enabled the determination of (trace) metals in single cells for the first time, showing great promise for a\u00a0variety of (bio)medical applications. Compared to traditional techniques, SC-ICP-MS offers\u00a0novel, previously unavailable information about the metal content of each individual cell in\u00a0the sample. This information can shed new light on problems in a wide variety of research\u00a0disciplines.\u00a0In the context of cancer research, SC-ICP-MS can be used to, e.g., monitor the cellular\u00a0uptake of metal-based anti-cancer drugs or to study the mechanism of photoporation in the\u00a0context of single-cell nanosurgery.",

It is a highly heterogeneous malignant hematological disorder that is driven by recurrent genetic abnormalities. Hence, the molecular genetic makeup of ALL influences treatment strategies and dictates risk stratification. GATA3 is a T-cell lineage transcription factor whose expression is tightly regulated during normal development of lymphoid progenitors.We discovered that significant elevated expression of GATA3 is a distinct feature of a subset of ALL cases that harbor fusion oncogenes. We hypothesize that aberrant expression of GATA3 is a unifying secondary genetic lesion in the pathogenesis of these ALL subsets that have different clinical and biological characteristics. Hence, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the role of GATA3 misexpression across these subsets. Ultimately, we hope this will improve the current classification of ALL and uncover potential therapeutic targets.",

The development of single-cell technologies has accelerated research in oncology by identifying heterogeneous cell (sub-)populations based on the epigenetic layers of information. In my project, I aim to give better insights of the systemic immunity associated with ICI therapy response, involved in NIPIT project (Non-Invasive Prediction of Immunotherapy Response). To achieve this goal, I analyze in-house single-cell sequencing data as well as bulk sequencing data of cancer patients\u2019 blood.

Identification of new biomarkers could help achieve this goal. Liquid biopsy approaches have arisen as an interesting opportunity to monitor biomarkers in a minimal invasive, longitudinal, sensitive, easily accessible, and cheap manner. In this aspect, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently demonstrated new biomarker potential against invasive tissue biopsy collection. EVs are nanosized lipid bilayer-surrounded particles that are secreted by almost every cell type, hereby forming a spatiotemporal fingerprint of the cell of origin that remains stable within the liquid biopsy. Tumor cells are known to produce large amounts of EVs, pointing to the potential diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive use of EV-derived information in cancer research.Next to EVs, dynamic evaluation of our immune system could offer biomarker potential, as our immune system is an important determinant of how the body eliminates the tumor and responds to therapy.With a focus on gynaecological cancer patients, my research aims to explore the role of EVs as communication vehicles between the tumor and the immune system.",

Therefore, new approaches are required to tackle these hurdles.The lab of prof. Bart Vandekerckhove was the first to identify an unconventional CD8 T cell (uT) population in humans, similar to the murine unconventional intraepithelial T cells. These cells are naturally tissue-homing and seem to perform an immune surveillance function.

While non-malignant cells can de novo synthesize sufficient levels of non-essential amino acids (NEAA), many cancer cells lose this ability and become auxotrophic for some NEAA: cancer cells have to take these up via their environment to sustain survival and proliferation. As a result, the NEAA bioavailability in the tumor microenvironment is a rate-limiting factor for the progression of various aggressive subtypes of cancers, like triple negative breast cancers (TNBC).A recent report demonstrated that asparagine bioavailability determines the metastatic potential of a murine breast carcinoma model (1). We have confirmed independently that asparagine is indeed a determining factor of metastasis in TNBC breast cancer models.One of the big questions remaining is where in the metastatic process the bioavailability of Asn is important. Further investigation using our in vitro ZEB1-inducible breast cancer cell lines demonstrates that breast cancer cells that undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) undergo a metabolic switch that results in a dependency for exogenous Asn uptake, which drives sensitivity of these invasive and circulating tumor cells to L-asparaginase treatment.Other questions remaining that I am trying to uncover are whether asparaginase treatment could also be beneficial for other solid cancers and whether other amino acids could also crucial for breast cancer metastasis and thus a potential targetable vulnerability. Next to that, we are generating less toxic asparaginases, making long-term treatment of solid cancers with asparaginase finally possible.",

The exposome is defined as the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan including exposures from the environment, diet, behaviour and endogenous processes.FLEXiGUT is the first large-scale exposomics study focused on chronic low-grade gut inflammation and related biological processes and diseases, including gastrointestinal cancers. Two Flemish prospective cohorts are used to cover the human life course: the \u201cENVIRONAGE birth cohort\u201d, a mother-child cohort from gestation to the age of 10 years, and the \u201cFlemish Gut Flora Project longitudinal cohort\u201d, a cohort of adults. To be able to answer the scientific questions of the project, it has been calculated that a sample size of 400 individuals is required for each cohort.Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by fungi when growing on crops used for human and animal consumption. Mycotoxins are significant to cancer research because long-term exposure can cause toxic effects such as genetic changes in target organs, resulting in cancer. For example, Aflatoxin B1 is known to covalently bind to DNA. The formation of these DNA adducts can lead to mutations and chemically-induced carcinogenesis. Mycotoxin biomarkers and metabolites in urine and blood will be analysed by LC-MS/MS. DNA adductomics will provide a direct reflection of the genotoxin exposure, effects and disease risk.To link the exposures and the health outcomes, the integration of multiple types of -omics datasets, that is, multi-omics will give opportunities for finding correlations between features, developing classifier and predictive models, discovering biomarkers and elucidate early molecular events in the pathways leading to cancer.",

Although many success stories have been described, the therapy still faces challenges due to issues related to production and quality.Within my research, I aim to generate universal off-the-shelf CAR T cells that help to overcome current limitations. To achieve this, I will optimize an in vitro differentiation system in which induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are differentiated towards T cells. A CAR will be inserted at the iPSCs level and the generated CAR T cells will be further validated via in vitro and in vivo functional assays. This project thus can aid in the development of an enhanced CAR T cell production platform to decrease the costs and accelerate the availability of the cell therapy product.",

For instance, morphogen gradients in embryos are tightly regulated to ensure the correct cell type differentiation in time and space; the liver lobule is divided in labor according to distance from the portal triad. Therefore, studying the spatial architecture of a tissue can reveal how cells interact and organize across the entire tissue landscape. In cancer research it can help to unravel how the different subtypes of infiltrating immune cells are selected or recruited to tumours, and then develop therapies that stimulate the immune system to fight cancer. Recently, single-cell sequencing technologies have uncovered previously unappreciated levels of cancer and immune cell heterogeneity. However, because this type of analysis demands that the tissue is dissociated and the cells segregated, their spatial context is lost. Spatially resolved genomic methods offer the solution to this challenge, providing genome-scale omics measurements while pre- serving spatial context. While the field is moving forward at rapid pace, those technologies still face multiple challenges, including sensitivity, labor intensiveness, and cost.My research focuses on developing a novel gene expression platform for spatially resolving single-cell transcriptomes using an in situ capturing technology. It involves the use of high-resolution microarrays printed with anchored oligo-dT capture probes with a unique spatial barcode for in situ cDNA synthesis. Concomitant with hardware developments, I aim to build a data-analysis strategy for scalable gene function evaluation of the resulting data.",

Expanding its benefits possibly goes through the development of combined therapiesSupported by CRIG young investigator grant, \u00a0I started to work with an immune stimulatory mRNA able to simultaneously overexpress exogenous proteins and downregulate endogenous proteins. Such strategy would enable inhibition of immunosuppressive pathways at the same time that cancer associated antigens or co-stimulatory molecules are expressed.Currently, my research is focused on influenza immunity. Influenza is annually responsible for about 500.000 deaths worldwide. The current Flu vaccines need to be updated every season and its effectiveness ranges from 19-60%. Defining better the breadth and immunogenicity of influenza A and B envelop proteins can offer a rational for the development of an improved supra-seasonal vaccine.",

TEs cause rewiring of gene regulatory networks through TE transposition, TE expression and/or TE enhancer activity, in a cell-type-specific way. However, the exact regulatory mechanisms are still unknown. Currently, the suboptimal performance of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics is hampering the study of TE activity.In my PhD, I aim unravel the role of TEs in healthy brain development and in neuropsychiatric disease, with a focus on TE-mediated gene regulatory networks and computational tools for the detection of TE activity from multi-omics data.",

        "research_focus": "Intracellular delivery of exogenous molecules into cells has become a crucial step for many therapeutic applications and fundamental biological research. However, to reach the cytosolic compartment, the plasma membrane barrier needs to be overcome, which is considered a major hurdle for biological macromolecules often exhibiting unfavorable characteristics like size, charge and stability.One way is by disrupting the plasma membrane using laser-induced vapor nanobubbles (VNBs), which makes use of photothermal nanoparticles and pulsed laser light. Upon pulsed laser irradiation, the nanoparticles rapidly heat up leading to the evaporation of their surrounding water. Fast-expanding VNBs emerge around the nanoparticles that, upon their collapse, impose significant mechanical stress on the plasma membrane leading to transient pore formation. During her PhD, Jana focused on employing laser-induced VNBs for several applications. On the one hand, she applied laser-induced VNBs for intracellular delivery and explored the potential to induce regulated (RCD) and/or immunogenic cell death (ICD). On the other hand, she investigated the potential of laser-induced VNBs to load extracellular vesicles (EVs) via the cell\u2019s cytosol.During her postdoctoral fellowship, Jana will continue to investigate the potential of laser-induced VNBs for loading of EVs with exogenous cargo molecules. To do so, the exogenous molecules are first loaded into the cell\u2019s cytosol laser-induced VNBs, after which they can be encapsulated into EVs. Given the versatility of this technique, both therapeutic and diagnostic compounds can be loaded. By minimally interfering with the surface properties of EVs, this strategy could serve as a platform technology to study intercellular communication within the tumor microenvironment and thereby support the development of anticancer strategies.",

However, relapses still occur, and the outcome for the refractory or (multiple) relapsed patients remains poor. The emerging precision medicine approach might improve the prognosis of these patients. To assign these patients to the best personalized treatments, there is need for deep molecular characterization, comprehensive immunophenotyping and functional drug response profiling.In this project we will generate patient-derived xenograft models from individual pediatric relapse and refractory leukemia patients to complement the original patient material for molecular analyses, flow cytometry and drug response profiling (ex vivo and in vivo). This way, the project can add indispensable information to assign the patient to the most appropriate early phase clinical trial.",

The tumor arises from neural crest cells during early embryonic development due to the deregulation of signaling pathways important for the development of the peripheral nervous system. Considering that NB is a childhood cancer, it is of utmost importance that we look for more targeted therapies which are associated with higher efficiencies and reduced toxicities.Importantly, in a tumor entity like NB characterized by a low mutational burden, the number of druggable genes for targeted therapy is limited. Interestingly though, translational addiction is now becoming recognized as a significant mechanism for cancer cells to upregulate non-mutated replicative stress-resistor genes, to which they become dependent for survival. With regards to NB, many of the candidate dependency genes are functionally connected to the Aurora Kinase A enzyme, highlighting the potential of the latter as a novel therapeutic target in NB.Throughout the course of my doctorate, I will be investigating selective Aurora Kinase A inhibition as a novel entry point to identify synthetic lethality targets in NB. In addition, I will explore the use of combined pharmacological inhibition together with protein degradation using a new and exciting class of drugs (PROTACs) as an innovative therapeutic approach in NB. Overall, my research aims to uncover a deeper understanding of the molecular aspects driving NB tumorigenesis and provide a boost in the search for novel targeted therapies for this potentially fatal childhood cancer.",

Central to the development and progression of melanoma is the delicate interplay between the transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2, which are predominantly recognized for their involvement in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, despite their cooperative roles in EMT-related processes, these transcription factors exhibit opposing functions within the context of melanoma. ZEB2 expression is essential for the initial growth of primary melanomas and their ability to establish metastases at secondary sites. Conversely, ZEB1 expression is linked to the activation of an invasive transcriptional program, primarily influenced by the tumor microenvironment, enabling melanoma cells to acquire invasive properties. The shift from ZEB2 to ZEB1 expression marks a critical milestone in malignant progression and is commonly associated with the \"phenotype switching\" phenomenon.Our research approach involves utilizing early passage melanoma cell lines, reporter cell lines, single-cell transcriptomics, and functional biology techniques. Our primary objective is investigating the physiological and pathological roles of EMT-inducing transcription factors within the melanocytic lineage which holds promise in unraveling how these master regulators orchestrate the acquisition of high-grade malignancy and resistance to therapeutic interventions in melanoma.",

        "research_focus": "Cancer is a major cause of mortality in companion animals. Anaesthesia is often required during the initial workup, surgical intervention, and follow-up of oncological patients. Peri-anaesthetic immunosuppression has been implicated as a factor in accelerated tumor progression, and the choice of anaesthetic technique may influence this phenomenon. Companion animals can play an important role in elucidating these effects since they are immunocompetent and develop spontaneous tumors while being exposed to environmental factors. Their shorter lifespan and faster progression of disease make it possible to measure short- & long-term outcomes.To our knowledge only two veterinary studies have prospectively examined the direct impact of anaesthetic technique on the immune system. Miyata et al. (2013) established that anaesthesia with isoflurane has a transient immunosuppressive effect by decreasing natural killer cytotoxic activity. Tomihari et al. (2015) showed that compared to propofol, isoflurane had a more pronounced immunosuppressant effect. State-of-the-art anesthetic techniques, however, encompass the use of balanced protocols and multimodal analgesic approaches. Although the associated reduction of side effects observed with the use of multimodal techniques is beneficial for the patient, the complex nature of these techniques makes it difficult to assess their impact on the immune system.With our study we want to prospectively evaluate the immunological effects of two modern multimodal anesthetic protocols on healthy dogs with and without surgical intervention. We will follow-up on a wide array of biomarkers in blood to assess the immunological status of the animals in the peri-anesthetic period. In a later phase, dogs with solid tumors will be enrolled to evaluate these effects in oncological patients.",

In addition, current MM therapy has a five-year survival rate of only ~50% and evokes many adverse side effects.Synthetic glucocorticoids, for example dexamethasone and prednisolone, are essential drugs in MM treatment as they induce apoptosis of the malignant myeloma cells by activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Despite significant advances in myeloma treatment, glucocorticoids remain an important pillar of the myeloma treatment protocol as they are still used in all treatment stages. Yet, treatment with high doses cause adverse side effects and GC-resistance in the long run, which severely hampers the patients\u2019 quality of life. Thus, it is crucial to develop more safe and efficient glucocorticoid-based treatment strategies. In this regard, we aim to circumvent the existing issues associated with GC-based MM therapies, as well as to improve the GC efficacy by targeting a recently discovered alternative mode of action involving the glucocorticoid receptor. Developing these novel therapeutic compounds will be supported by the expertise of two labs (prof. K. De Bosscher: MM biology andprof. M. D\u2019hooghe: organic synthesis).",

Moreover, innovative pharmaceutical platforms such as nanoparticles and controlled release systems are thought to further boost locoregional drug delivery.The Research project focuses on the aspects of a novel delivery technique (ePIPAC: electrostatic pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy) to deliver Nanoparticles to the peritoneal cavity, to treat peritoneal carcinomatosis. The main research questions involve exploring the mechanisms that govern NP penetration in healthy and tumor tissue after Intraperitoneal aerosol delivery under the influence of an external electrical and/or electrostatic field. Therefore, we developed an ex vivo model to test the effect of high pressure nebulization of nanoparticles on isolated peritoneal tissue. Different controlled release systems will be evaluated in vitro and further optimized in vivo in a rat model of peritoneal carcinomatosis using different techniques.",

It involves administering photosensitizers that are taken up by cancer cells, which, when irradiated with an appropriate wavelength of light, convert cellular oxygen into cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, leading to cancer cell death. Notably, several photosensitizers induce immunogenic cell death (ICD), a form of cancer cell death that activates the immune system, thereby potentially enhancing treatment efficacy and offering long-term protection against cancer. However, current clinically employed photosensitizers are not designed to induce ICD and can only be activated by wavelengths with limited penetration depth, making PDT unsuitable for treating large or deep-seated tumors.My research focuses on identifying novel photosensitizers that induce robust ICD and can be activated by light with greater tissue penetration, thereby enhancing PDT's effectiveness in treating infiltrative cancers such as glioblastoma. By studying the biological impact of these novel photosensitizers on glioblastoma cell lines and healthy brain cultures, I aim to gain initial insights into their therapeutic potential for glioblastoma treatment. Additionally, this research explores the use of these photosensitizers in the development of PDT-based dendritic cell vaccines, which will be tested in orthotopic glioblastoma intracranial models alongside standard-of-care treatments, to better reflect the clinical scenario and improve the translatability of the results. With this research, the CDIT aims to advance PDT-based immunotherapeutic strategies to address the urgent need for effective glioblastoma therapies",

Despite rapid advancements in the field, questions persist about specific tumor components contributing to cell-free nucleic acid presence. To grasp the full potential of circulating tumor nucleic acids in clinicopathologic applications, it is necessary to better comprehend the representation of (sub)clones in blood. To investigate this, molecularly barcoded mouse models can be used. In my research I will focus on neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer with known tumor heterogeneity that contributes to therapy resistance.In my postdoctoral research I investigate the spatial location of the subclones releasing nucleic acids in blood in neuroblastoma mouse models and I will determine how the nucleic acid composition changes upon therapy resistance. To do this, mouse models with molecularly barcoded tumors will be used to trace DNA and RNA coming from different genetic tumor clones. With this research I aim to address some of the knowledge gaps in the liquid biopsy field that are needed for optimizing and interpreting liquid biopsy assays and advancing personalized medicine.In addition, I am involved in the project around Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP). Patients with a CUP have a metastasized cancer for which the tissue-of-origin cannot be determined (around 3-5% of cancer patients). Uncertainty about their diagnosis, prognosis and planned therapies is often listed as one of the main causes of anxiety in these patients and is severely impacting the quality of life. In this project we use methylation patterns of the cell-free DNA in liquid biopsies (including blood) to determine the tissue-of-origin in CUPs).",

An essential hallmark of all tumors is the local inflammatory microenvironment and influx of inflammatory immune cells; however, the relevance of these tumor-infiltrating immune cells is highly complex, contextual and only starting to be elucidated.My research focusses on understanding the relationship between type 2 immunity, cancer, and metastatic dissemination to the lungs, which is especially important for the ever growing population of patients suffering from allergies and asthma. Who have a life-long bias of type 2 immune responses, including enhanced IL-33 production, lung eosinophilia, ILC2 and memory CD4+ Th2 cell accumulation in their tissues, and are increasingly treated with biologicals that undermine the key cytokines of type 2 immunity. Although it is becoming clear that type 2 inflammation plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are ill-described and the possible dichotomous functions of stroma and cancer-derived pro-Th2 alarmins and subsequent type 2 effector pathways in tumor immunity in various cancers have yet to be determined. We set out to unravel the complex interplay between innate and adaptive immune cells and the stroma and how this creates a favorable niche for disseminated cancer cells to establish metastatic foci.",

PT has is considered more expensive than XT due to higher investment and operational costs and it needs to prove its value through better patient outcomes, such as reduced toxicity and improved survival rates. This research project employs a time-driven activity-based costing (TD-ABC) methodology to estimate the costs associated with both PT, considering variables like the treatment complexity of PT therapy, equipment utilized, and personnel involved in the health care provision . Updated cost models for PT will be developed and applied to locally advanced esophageal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Belgium, with continuous monitoring and updates to ensure accurate cost-effectiveness assessments.The research also aims to create a Markov model to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis, expressing the outcomes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This model will consider both the upfront costs and the healthcare outcomes associated with PT and XT, using real-world data to adjust predictions for toxicities and survival outcomes. The study integrates these cost-effectiveness evaluations into the existing NTCP (Normal Tissue Complication Probability) model framework to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PT versus XT. Various scenarios will be simulated to assess the cost-effectiveness of PT under different conditions, with the ultimate goal of providing a comprehensive and objective report on the feasibility and financial impact of implementing PT in the Belgian healthcare system.",

To tackle these unmet needs, we aim to integrate existing pain interventions offered by multiple professionals and healthcare settings, following a step-wise care model.

They represent 10-15% of the pediatric and 25% of the adult ALL cases. Although initially T-ALL was associated with a high relapse rate, the current prognosis has significantly improved by the introduction of intensified chemotherapy in combination with stem cell transplantation. Modern treatment protocols reach cure rates of 85-90% in children and about 50% in adults. Nonetheless, this coincides with both severe short- and long-term side effects. Additionally, the outcome for primary therapy resistant or relapsed patients remains extremely poor. Therefore, the need for novel targeted therapies that improve the prognosis of high-risk refractory/relapsed T-ALL patients remains very high.In my research, the focus lies on investigating the microenvironment of T-ALL. We aim to discover a novel treatment approach by identifying and targeting active pathways that become triggered by aberrantly expressed cytokines. We will analyze this in-vitro, as well as in ex-vivo patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cultures and ultimately in an in-vivo PDX setting. Additionally, we will attempt to develop T-ALL PDX models in CD34+ humanized mice to investigate how the normal immune microenvironment influences T-ALL development and - vice versa \u2013 how T-ALL development influences the immune system.",

        "research_focus": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide for which, in case of advanced disease, the current standard therapy has limited survival benefit. Early diagnosis and correct estimation of prognosis is crucial.In this era of personalized medicine, there is a need for a new generation of biomarkers that can provide a correct estimation of prognosis when a certain treatment strategy is being considered and there is a need for biomarkers that can monitor closely the response upon treatment and early relapse after treatment. There are strong arguments to support the hypothesis that glycomics-based biomarkers could answer this medical need. Glycosylation of serum proteins is the most frequent posttranslational modification observed in the human body and alterations in this protein glycosylation has been extensively linked to cancer development. Specific glycomic alterations described as increased fucosylation and presence of multi-branched glycans can be easily measured in serum and are present in patients with HCC. Preliminary data indicate that specific glycomic changes are related to outcome after treatment of HCC, and thus could be the basis for prognostic biomarkers. The rationale supports also the hypothesis that glycomic changes occur during response to treatment of HCC and relapse, and thus could be the basis for a biomarker that can monitor disease activity.The aim of this interventional study (retrospective and prospective) is to develop 2 biomarkers. One that can predict outcome before treatment for HCC is started. The other one to monitor successful treatment and early relapse after treatment. Both biomarkers could radically change the approach of HCC patients.First of all, we could prevent the use of futile treatments if before the start of the treatment the biomarker could tell us that the disease will not respond to treatment. In that case, the clinician can opt for another and better treatment strategy. Furthermore, this can prevent unnessecary toxicity for the patient and reduce the costs of treatment. Treatment regimens include liver transplantation, tumor resection, loco-regional therapies such as ablation-trans arterial chemo- or radio embolisation, systemic therapy (eg. sorafenib) or best supportive care.Second, we could monitor early relapse of HCC, before clinical imaging can show the relapse. This can lead to an important gain in time, providing a window of opportunity for treatment shift in a very early disease stage, which cannot be achieved today .",

Traditionally considered as a means of achieving local tumor control through induction of DNA damage in irradiated tumor cells, radiotherapy is used in routine clinical practice across all disease stages, whether with curative or palliative intent. However, since as early as 1953, reports have been published describing tumor regression outside the radiation fields. This so-called \u201cabscopal effect\u201d has more recently been postulated to be the result of a radiotherapy-induced antitumor immune response.With the advent of modern immunotherapy, in particular immune checkpoint inhibitors, the potential for immune activation by radiotherapy has become even more relevant. Indeed, mounting preclinical and clinical evidence suggests a potential synergy between both treatment modalities, creating opportunities for combination strategies across many different cancer types.Our research aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy-radiotherapy combinations in advanced solid tumors. Furthermore, translational research will help to elucidate the complex interactions between both treatment modalities on a molecular level. In turn, this may lead to the identification of novel predictive and prognostic biomarkers.",

In fact were BCL10 and MALT1 originally identified in B cell lymphomas and only later identified as critical signaling components in immune cells. In the context of immunity, current cancer research on check point inhibitors also offers us novel insights in immune regulation. Also here I think that the interaction can be bidirectional. For example are there indications that MALT1 protease inhibitors influence Treg function, which could complement or enhance other check point inhibition strategies.In recent years, I have also initiated a novel independent research line focusing on secondary metabolites commonly known as \u201cphytohormones\u201d (abscisic acid, auxins, cytokinins, salicylic acid) that also are endogenously produced in humans. These compounds all have potential effects on inflammation, but especially auxins (via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and immune check point inhibition resistance) and cytokinins (as adenosine receptor ligands) may also play important roles in cancer.",

However, around 20% of patients experience relapse after initial treatment, and up to 25% of Wilms tumor survivors may suffer from severe chronic side effects. Furthermore, some subtypes of Wilms tumor have a less favorable prognosis, making it crucial to identify more targeted treatment approaches. However, there are only a limited number of animal models available, hindering our understanding of these tumors. Therefore, the goal of this research project is to develop new models for clinically identified Wilms tumor subtypes using Xenopus tropicalis, an organism in which genetic modification via CRISPR technologies is easily andefficiently applicable. By thoroughly examining gene expression and the epigenetic state of the genome in these models and comparing them with mouse models and human organoids, we aim to identify new vulnerabilities for subtype specific Wilms tumor. A previously established pipeline for CRISPR mediated dependency mapping is used to assess possible critical genetic vulnerabilities in these tumors. The ultimate aim of this project is to utilize the insights gained to uncover advanced, more precise treatments, thereby enhancing patient care and diminishing the likelihood of enduring complications.",

Research has revealed that GR, upon ligand activation, can form close interactions with other nuclear receptors such as the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), its most closely related family member.In this research, we work with a novel type of small molecules that allow to study a crosstalk between the GR and MR. New bioassays will be generated to enable rapid and low-cost screening of these new molecules to assess if they can efficiently kill myeloma cells. In addition, transcriptomics and proteomics analyses will contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of GR-MR signaling. Further validation using patient-derived myeloma cells and in vivo myeloma models will elucidate if these new small molecules can be exploited as a novel therapy to combat multiple myeloma while mitigating side effects.",

As an answer to this urgent need, our group has developed an immunocompetent intraductal mouse model for TNBC that relies on the injection of triple-negative mouse mammary tumor cells through the teat canal into the mammary ducts of syngeneic and lactating female mice. This model has been characterized during my PhD and recapitulates the complete human TNBC process from early ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to late invasive carcinoma and metastasis. The immunological responses that accompany the tumor progression in this model have also been evaluated and are highly comparable to the tumor immunology found in TNBC patients. The intraductal model is now being explored in collaboration with industrial and academic partners for preclinical testing of novel drugs before entry into clinical trial. This translational research has already provided promising data.",

Preliminary data using the prone crawl position confirmed lower radiation doses for lungs, thyroid, oesophagus and contralateral breast, while at the same time improving dose homogeneity for whole breast and lymph node targets, compared to the regularly used supine position. After confirming the applicability and the potential of this new treatment position, it is important to optimize it for widespread use in the clinic. An important step to standardise treatment in a new treatment position is the development of position specific delineation guidelines. During my PhD I developed new delineation guidelines for the lymphatic target volumes in prone crawl position, with the help of MRI and CT data and anatomical experiments. Apart from making new guidelines, a big part of my PhD revolved around mapping the lymphatic system. Experiments included the development of several methodologies for retrograde lymphatic injection to fill the lymphatics with contrast agent. Contrast filled lymphatics will show up on CT scans, so their position can be related to the surrounding anatomical structures that are used as reference structures for guideline application.For the continuation of my research I will now focus on long deep inspiration breath holds in prone crawl position. By helping the patient perform a breath hold of several minutes, aided by hyperventilation and oxygen administration, radiotherapy can be administered with minimal movement of the internal organs during treatment. By limiting this movement of internal organs during treatment, radiation exposure to organs at risk (heart and lungs) is expected to be lower compared to treatment during free breathing. If radiation doses to organs at risk can be limited, side effects of the treatment can further be reduced. My role in this project will be to analyse the anatomical data and quantify organ movement in different scenarios, which in turn could provide further refinement of the breath hold technique in prone crawl position.",

TAMs are versatile cells, which, depending on their microenvironment and localization within the tumor, can adopt different phenotypes. The M1 phenotype activates anti-tumor immunity, and the M2 phenotype promotes angiogenesis and cancer progression. In most cancers, M2-TAMs with a high expression of the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR, CD206) were shown to exhibit a strong immune suppressive activity, identifying them as interesting targets for cancer therapy. However, there is no specific conclusion about the equilibrium and reprogramming mechanism between M1/M2 TAMs.My research focuses on perturbing tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) equilibrium using nanobodies and nanoparticles in breast cancer. The nanobodies will be generated and characterized to reveal specific pathways that TAMs are re-educated by, to develop novel strategies combined with nanoparticles for redirecting TAMs to tumoricidal effectors, and dissect tumor/macrophage molecular interactions.",

With their health-related quality of life still being lower than the general population, many cancer survivors experience fatigue, pain, sleep problems, anxiety, depression, and many more. Physical activity (PA) and participating in a physically active lifestyle may offer a solution to these experiences. Despite the benefits, not many survivors meet the recommended physical activity guidelines. There is a need for a low-threshold intervention that supports and coaches cancer survivors in achieving an active lifestyle. Digital interventions are a promising avenue to achieve this goal, but available interventions are often not tailored to the target group or the preferences and wishes of the individual.In this project, a personalized mHealth intervention will be developed to promote a healthy lifestyle in cancer survivors. This project will come about through interdisciplinary collaboration between the behavioral and engineering sciences In the long-term the intervention may be used both as a stand-alone intervention, with the potential to reach many, as well as embedded in combination with face-to face contact with a healthcare provider (blended care).",

Increasing evidence shows that the microbiota influences both cancer initiation, progression and therapeutic response although the underlying mechanisms areincompletely understood, but involve cross-interaction between microbiota, immune and tumor components. Despite high success rates in other cancer types, immune checkpoint inhibition therapy (ICI), is not efficacious in most prevalent CRC subtypes. Observations in melanoma and lung cancer indicate that microbiota composition is a very important determinant of ICI efficacy. Therefore, we hypothesize that microbiota modulation during ICI therapy is essential to improve its efficacy in CRC. My research is focused on studying the impact of microbiota in CRC immunity and immune therapy, using a unique in house-developed, 100% penetrant mouse model of CRC which is microbiome dependent. During this project, we will study the contribution of various immune components and evaluate immunological and microbiome interventions to assess CRC development and immune therapy efficacy.This study will open new perspectives for microbiota-immune based diagnostics and therapeutics in CRC. In addition, we believe that our research is interesting for scientists in the microbiome and cancer field, since specific microbiome profiles may be shared among different diseases, thus improving the understanding on different disease mechanisms.",

Metastatic SCCs represent a significant unmet medical need, as the 5-year survival rate remains below 50%. Previous research by our team identified excessive death of keratinocytes as a driver of squamous carcinogenesis in the skin. Apoptotic cell death, classically known to be immune silent and protective against tumor initiation, has in more recent years been reconsidered as putatively promoting tumor progression. Besides apoptosis, dysregulation of another cell death programs, namely necroptosis, can impact carcinogenesis. However, while many anti-cancer treatments aim to induce cell death broadly, there is limited understanding of the specific pathways of cell death involved and their effects on inflammation and proliferation in the tumor niche.Our aim is to map the contribution of different types of regulated cell death to squamous tumorigenesis and stem cell plasticity. This study on SCC will allow to determine if the manipulation of keratinocytes cell death mediators has a significant therapeutic potential against cancer. Preliminary data on both cSCC and oSCC chemically-induced models are showing a promising contribution of cell death pathways in tumorigenesis, the final goal is to extrapolate these findings to other tissues and humans.Our findings will contribute to understanding the link between the different keratinocytes cell death modalities and squamous carcinogenesis, aiming to provide the scientific basis for more precise and efficient treatment options for SCC patients in future clinical cancer care.",

The tumour at the original\u00a0location of the body (primary tissue) has the same type of cancer cells than the spread\u00a0(metastatic) cancer.If we could identify the issue of origin and determine the specific type\u00a0of cancer, we could overcome limitations of the chemotherapy by personalising the\u00a0treatment options and this way, improve the currently poor survival of metastatic cancer.\u00a0There has been evidence shown in the scientific literature that DNA methylation pattern\u00a0(i.e., modifications on the DNA) can serve as a \u2018molecular fingerprint\u2019 or identification\u00a0marker to classify tumour types. However, to acquire samples of the tumour DNA, biopsy is\u00a0often applied. To avoid this invasive procedure, the circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in\u00a0blood can be exploited.

Untargeted bio-imaging applications are mainly focused on revealing the 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional distribution of the metallome, i.e. the entirety of metals and metalloids in biological tissues and cells, and metal-based anticancer drugs, e.g., cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. Quantitative spatial information provides profound insights into the penetration depth of metal-based complexes in tumor tissue and multi-cellular tumor spheroids. Single-cell LA-ICP-MS methodology has been developed to quantify the cellular uptake of newly developed metal-based complexes which can serve as a tool to evaluate drug candidates during pre-clinical stages. LA-ICP-MS can also be used to study the fate of metal-based nanoparticle drug carriers and moreover, \u00a0targeted multiplexed proteomic bio-imaging can be performed via the combined use of metal-conjugated antibodies.In the contexts described above, the A&MS research unit is cooperating with departments of the Ghent University Hospital, the Leiden University Medical Centre, Maastricht University and Janssen Pharmaceutica.",

Nevertheless, 30-35% of patients die from resistant disease, relapse or treatment-related toxicity, which catalogues AML as \u201cdifficult-to-treat\u201d disease. The recent success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy directed towards CD19 and the CD19-Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE) Blinatumomab in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has demonstrated the feasibility of applying immunotherapies in childhood cancer, but also highlighted some of the pitfalls that may be encountered in its early phase development. The fundamental biological factor limiting the extension of immunotherapy for the treatment of AML is the lack of a leukemia-specific antigen, or an antigen shared by haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells whose sustained depletion could be clinically tolerated.We have previously performed extensive transcriptome analysis of sorted AML LSCs, blasts and their normal counterparts and identified several interesting therapeutic targets to be explored. Until today, only one such target, TARP, has been fully evaluated and brought to preclinical evaluation. Based on this previous successful experience, bringing TARP-directed immunotherapy to preclinical evaluation, we aim in this project to uncover the potential of two other therapeutic targets that we identified in the datasets previously generated.The ultimate goal of this research project is outcome improvement of relapsed or refractory pediatric AML by providing preclinical in vitro and in vivo evidence for efficacy and safety of cellular immunotherapy directed towards an AML-specific antigen.",

My goal is to advance animal virus and host cell engineering to perform fundamental viral pathogenesis research, including that of virus-induced oncogenesis. This includes dissecting virus-host interactions that promote tumor formation and disturb immune-mediated tumor clearance. In turn, I aim to develop novel platforms that disrupt viral oncogenes or reprogram the immune response by combining gene editing with targeted cell delivery. As such, this dual approach can be used to treat viral oncogenesis in animals and ultimately pave the way for addressing analogous diseases in the human cancer field.",

GT perfusion is an important predictor for anastomotic integrity. Indocyanine green fluorescence angiography (ICGA) and Hyper spectral imaging (HSI) are both assessment tool for GT perfusion. Our research aims to quantify ICGA and HSI in the assessment of GT perfusion.When AL occurs, the morbidity is determined by the severity of the inflammation, the extent of contamination and the degree of sepsis, all related to the time between diagnosis and treatment of the AL. Early detection and prediction of AL based on inflammatory biomarkers is another research topic of our group.A third research line focusses on prevention of AL through enhancement of the esophagogastric anastomosis with a biological autologous BioMatrix.Many patients will develop functional disorders resulting in impaired QoL. We therefor have a group focusing on functional outcome after esophagectomy.",

Using integrated data mining strategies, our research team recently identified several novel dependencies connected to replicative stress resistance, including PFH6, an important epigenetic regulator in haemapoietic stem cells.My PhD project focuses on the nuclear pore complexes in collaboration with PHF6 as an important interaction network for control of gene regulation and nucleocytoplasmic transport. A detailed dissection of this network will aim to identify innovative therapeutic targets for neuroblastoma and other related pediatric tumor entities. In a first part of the project, the interaction between histone modifications, PHF6 and parts of the nuclear pore complex will be studied in more detail. Secondly, this project aims to unravel the functional role of the nuclear pore complex in replication stress resistance in neuroblastoma. The final part of the project will focus on identifying new combination therapies with the pharmacological inhibition of the activities of the nuclear pore complex as a starting point.",

Nevertheless, existing predictive biomarkers cannot accurately discriminate non-responder from responder patients and require invasive tumor tissue sampling. A group of these ICI treated patients develop immune-related adverse effects (irAEs). Also for irAEs no accurate predictive biomarkers currently exist. Recently, evidence accumulated that tumor regression as well as toxicity under ICIs is correlated with changes in specific immune cells in the peripheral blood.We aim to develop a blood-based test that interrogates these systemic immune profile signatures. My host lab optimized a transcriptome and deconvolution-based method to interrogate immune cell proportions in whole blood samples of ICI treated lung cancer patients. I will use this strategy in both melanoma and renal cell carcinoma patients to identify and quantify common and distinct immune cell types that are predictive for response. On top, I will study the relation of toxicities with the systemic immune cell proportions.In conclusion, this research project will bring us closer to deliver non- invasive tests for immunotherapy-treated patients.",

With breast cancer being the most common cancer affecting women worldwide, there is a clinical need for reconstructive strategies addressing current drawbacks and limitations. The development of biomimetic materials able to promote proliferation and adipogenic differentiation have gained increasing attention for adipose reconstructive purposes.The aim of the current research project includes the development of hydrogels, able to function as a bio-ink for 3D printing purposes. Furthermore, biocompatibility, neovascularization and adipogenic differentiation of the encapsulated cells will be assessed. The project outcome could offer a shift towards a patient-specific 3D printed, reconstructive approach, that can potentially be safer and more cost-effective.",

The incidence of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity\u00a0has been estimated to range between 40 and 80%, resulting in bilateral permanent or\u00a0sometimes progressive sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and tinnitus. Carboplatin has long\u00a0been considered less ototoxic than cisplatin. Reports on the incidence of carboplatin\u0002induced hearing loss range from 7% to 15% when evaluated with pure-tone audiometry.\u00a0However, recent animal-research studies have shown that carboplatin induces selective\u00a0damage to the inner hair cells and auditory nerve fibers, i.e., cochlear synaptopathy.\u00a0Patients report tinnitus and a decreased ability to understand speech in a noisy\u00a0environment.Permanent SNHL caused by ototoxic drugs can have serious professional, educational, and\u00a0social consequences that impair quality of life, integration and participation in the society\u00a0during and after cancer treatment. Next to hearing problems, balance complaints are\u00a0reported in these patients.

Systemic therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as Sorafenib or, since November 2020, the combination of a TKI and an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) (Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab) only provides a short\u00a0survival benefit for only a subset of patients and exhibits substantial adverse effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new treatment options using combination therapies with complementary mechanisms to maximize efficacy and minimize resistance.Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are a large family of druggable enzymes that control oncoproteins or their regulators. We have already shown that inhibition of a specific deubiquitinase strongly sensitizes HCC cells to the clinically used TKIs.We optimize imaging-based in vitro spheroid (invasion) screening to investigate e.g. DUB targeting in combination with TKIs or ICIs and also developed novel software for robust and detailed high throughput analysis of the drug effects on the 3D in-vitro spheroid cultures.",

However this method is invasive and harmful for patients and is often not representative for the entire (sometimes metastatic) tumor, creating a sampling bias. Furthermore, tissue biopsies require a detectable and accessible tumor, which is not always present. Liquid biopsies is a technique which holds promise to overcome many of these issue. With a liquid biopsy, biofluids like plasma are screened for biomarkers such as RNA, DNA and proteins. Currently, there is an increased interest in the use of liquid biopsies since this method is minimally invasive, less expensive compared to tissue biopsies and it provides information about spatial and/or subclonal tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, liquid biopsies enable repeated sampling, allowing follow-up of the patient in real-time during and after treatment. My project is focused on developing and applying liquid biopsies technology for deep profiling of tumor and micro-environment derived nucleic acids to allow non-invasive monitoring of tumor growth.My research also focuses on the development of a novel spatial transcriptomics technology to allow monitoring of the immune response during therapy, to follow-up tumor heterogeneity and to deconvolute the different cell types present in a tumor."

With novel sequencing techniques like cell free reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (cfRRBS) we are able to perform a cost-effective analysis of the methylation of cell free DNA (cfDNA) in the blood of patients. This non-invasive test could prove to be an interesting tool not only for diagnosis but also follow up of the tumor. A strong focus lies on the research of several lymphoma subtypes as it is often difficult to obtain a good tissue biopsy of lymphoma that contains enough tumor cells for effective sequencing. Liquid biopsy can be the answer for these types of tumors as often the amount of tumoral DNA found in these samples can be higher than what can be extracted from the tissue biopsies. With the methylation data from liquid biopsies of patients many types of machine-learning models can be trained to either predict the tumor type or tumor load in the blood.During my project I will use cfRRBS to study the cfDNA methylation in various types of liquid biopsies in order to create robust predictive models that can aid diagnosis.",

Many techniques have been developed to overcome these barriers, including direct injections of substances by intranasal or intrathecal routes, chemical modification of drug, physical disruption of brain barriers and so on. However, none of these methods have been approved for treatment of brain tumors yet. Here, we will enter the brain via a different angle, we use a VHH to target FOLR1 which is highly expressed at the brain barrier, more precisely the blood-CSF barrier. \u00a0As proliferating tissues harbor increased folate requirement and thereby show high FOLR1 expression, we hypothesize that once our anti-FOLR1 VHH is in the brain, our VHH can target FOLR1 positive brain cancer cells.We are currently investigating if our FOLR1-targeting VHH has clinical potential to guide therapeutics and imaging agents to FOLR1 positive brain tumors. This project will yield novel insights into the use of a FOLR1-targeting VHH as tumor-targeting therapeutics and imaging agent.",

While there is a good deal of information available on the psychosocial impact of childhood cancer on the one hand, and on the psychosocial impact of adult late onset hereditary cancer syndromes (e.g., HBOC and Lynch syndrome) on the other hand, there is only limited data available on the psychosocial impact of hereditary cancer syndromes in children. As genetic testing has potential implications for both patients and their family members (parents, siblings), we involve the perspectives of the entire family system in this study.AimWe examine:the decision making process regarding genetic testing (I.e., the uptake of and reasons for (not) undergoing genetic testing)the psychosocial impact of CPS among children and their family members ( on both the short- and long-term)the perceived need for professional psychosocial support in the genetic testing processthe knowledge about genetics among families with a CPS and how this affects the advice given, uptake of and experience with regular surveillance for CPSStrategyIn order to fully capture how cancer genetics research influences each of the family members, a multi-method (systematic review, longitudinal survey, interviews) and multi-informant approach is used.",

Recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy or local therapy with curative intent occurs in 30-40% of patients within 10 years. Biomarkers such as Prostate Specific Antigen are used for follow up of disease status in patients with prostate cancer. However, for salvage therapy to be successful, precise localization of metastases is necessary to determine the most appropriate treatment and to postpone expensive systemic therapies with their inherent toxicity. Recently, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has gained interest for PCa-specific imaging. Due to overexpression of PSMA in both primary and metastatic PCa, radiotracers targeting this protein have shown an increased selectivity and sensitivity compared to conventional imaging.Our research team developed a new PET radiotracer, [18F]PSMA-11, for imaging PSMA in prostate cancer patients. During a phase 1 and 2 clinical trial, the safety of administration and the patient dosimetry has been evaluated, and the scan protocol has been optimized. Subsequently, a phase 3 clinical trial was conducted demonstrating non-inferiority of [18F]PSMA-11 vs. [68Ga]PSMA-11.",

Synthetic variants of glucocorticoids have been developed to battle inflammation and cancer. However, their chronic use leads to severe side effects and therapy resistance. GR, which is also a transcription factor, is an intriguing protein as the structure of this multi-domain protein dynamically responds to interactions with ligands, other proteins (e.g. coregulators), and glucocorticoid response elements in the DNA. As a result, several research programs focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms steering the receptor\u2019s many different structures and on developing new, often non-steroidal ligands that drive GR into the most optimal structure in terms of beneficial effects for patients under (synthetic) glucocorticoid treatment.My promoters\u2019 research groups have jointly discovered that the structural plasticity of GR can be revealed by proteomics in an in vitro setup. My aim is to develop a highly controllable technology in which a promiscuous protease is activated in living cells to then introduce cuts in surface-accessible regions of proteins in their natural environment, this to study protein structures and changes thereof. By a comparative analysis using various ligands of GR, I expect to reveal, using a quantitative mass spectrometry read-out, how GR's structure is being controlled in its natural environment. I will thus develop a powerful assay that allows classifying ligands for GR at the early step of target engagement. This way ligands with a similar behavior, esp. those with a better therapeutic benefit, will be identified in a faster and more reliable manner.",

In addition, by using different types of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are emerging as vehicles for antigen cargo in \u00a0 vaccination therapies, they noticed they can steer DC maturation pathways in vivo, thereby changing how the encoded antigens are being perceived.This knowledge will now be applied to the tumor environment where we want to address two key questions:1) what drives DC maturation within the tumor, and2) how does the type of cell death in the tumor affect the DC maturation program?These two questions will translate our previous findings in steady state conditions to the tumor environment and may lay the foundations for a rational design of LNP-based vaccines in tumor therapy.",

The majority of lung cancer patients are diagnosed at the metastatic stage and due to drug resistance high relapse rates, 5 year overall survival is around 5%.In the recent years, immune checkpoint blockers (ICB), acting by blocking receptor ligand interactions that cause exhaustion of tumor killer T cells, have revolutionized standard-of-care for several cancer indications. One of the best success stories is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however only a minority of patients respond, and those who do respond eventually experience disease relapse.ICB fix only a late step in the chain of events leading to T cell induced tumor destruction (as referred to in the cancer-immunity cycle). Upstream of this is a complex process of tumor antigen uptake, processing and presentation by dendritic cells (DCs). Indeed, DCs perform several critical steps in cancer immunotherapy. However, the overwhelming majority of endogenous DCs are dysfunctional. DC-based immunotherapy aims to replace a critical system that is inherently defective in cancer patients.We are currently exploring the therapeutic potential of immunostimulatory DCs, generated ex vivo from patient blood as a vaccine regimen for NSCLC patients. Two first-in-human clinical trials in patients affected with NSCL have recently been completed.My research at the Thoracic Tumor Immunology Lab of the Dept. of Pulmonary Medicine will further focus on ways to re-engineer DCs in order to make our next-generation DC vaccine. We developed a target discovery platform based on i) in silico prediction; ii) in vitro screening and ii) in vivo evaluation in a humanised mouse model. With this, proof-of-concept can be validated and mechanisms of action can be unraveled.In addition, I will further focus on the use of mRNA to reprogram immune cell behaviour and ignite the tumor microenvironment.",

In addition, we observed that pre-analytical factors play a major role in blood-based pediatric cancer diagnostics. We are now combining the knowledge gained from these early studies to initiate prospective trials that will highlight the true benefit of this approach.",

Specifically, we are evaluating the use of Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure thyroglobulin (Tg) levels in the serum of patients suffering from DTC. Accurate Tg measurement is crucial for monitoring DTC recurrence, as results from current immunometric assays are compromised in up to 25% of patients due to anti-Tg autoantibodies. Using peptide immuno-enrichment in combination with LC-MS offers a more reliable alternative, potentially reducing the need for expensive and less sensitive imaging methods. Additionally, integrating new plasma proteomics workflows could facilitate the discovery of new potential biomarkers for DTC and other cancer types, enabling the monitoring of disease progression and evaluation of therapeutic responses.Furthermore, I am investigating Histone Post-Translational Modifications (hPTMs), which play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, chromatin structure, and DNA repair. Abnormal hPTM patterns can lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes or the activation of oncogenes, driving malignant transformation and progression. Screening for such epigenetic changes is therefore of great interest. In collaboration with Prof. Pieter Van Vlierberghe (Lab of Normal and Malignant Hematopoiesis, Center for Medical Genetics, UGent), we have already mapped the baseline hPTM profile of 21 T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines using LC-MS.In summary, my research integrates analytical chemistry, molecular biology, and clinical diagnostics to advance cancer research through robust, high-throughput biomarker detection methods. My ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes by enhancing diagnostic capabilities and supporting the development of personalized medicine approaches.",

While significant progress has been made in treating pediatric T-ALL, the prognosis for adult T-ALL remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%. In case of relapse/refractory (R/R) T-ALL, the long-term survival rates are even more dismal (<10%), mainly due to the limited therapeutic options and the high toxicity of available treatments. \u00a0This highlights an urgent clinical need for alternative treatment strategies.A promising strategy to overcome current therapeutic limitations is the development of functional precision medicine based on patient-specific drug response profiling (DRP). My research is dedicated to optimizing salvage therapeutic strategies for adult R/R T-ALL patients by using this approach. We aim to set up a pipeline for functional ex vivo drug response profiling on primary samples from T-ALL patients, in order to guide clinical decision making in case of relapse or refractory disease. By integrating the DRP-results from diagnosis and relapse with comprehensive genomic, proteomic and transcriptomic data, our goal is to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying therapy resistance and identify biomarkers that predict the efficacy of novel salvage therapeutic strategies. This personalized approach aims to move beyond the trial-and-error method currently used in selecting salvage therapies, providing tailored treatment options that improve patient outcomes.Furthermore, we will evaluate the effectiveness of these novel therapies using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, enabling in vivo testing of drug responses. This research not only aims to enhance treatment for T-ALL patients, but also contributes to the broader field of cancer research by developing methodologies that can be applied to other malignancies. Through multidisciplinary and international collaboration, and integration of cutting-edge technologies, our work aims to improve the prognosis for T-ALL patients and advance the understanding of cancer resistance mechanisms, ultimately bridging the gap from bench to bedside by translating scientific discoveries into clinical applications for the benefit of patients.",

This cancer is treated by standard chemotherapy that can cure 80% of children diagnosed with T-ALL and 50% of the adult cases. However the outcome of T-ALL patients that relapse or seem to be resistant against given therapy remains poor. Also the standard chemotherapy can cause a lot of unwanted side-effects.We aim to generate safer formulations of an existing FDA-approved drug called L-asparaginase that is nowadays used in the clinic to treat ALL patients. If we can provide sufficient evidence by using in vivo preclinical mouse models of ALL that these drugs are less toxic, less immunogenic and as effective as the current formulations, clinical trials in human patients/volunteers can start immediately after the end of the project. In the case of existing drug that is FDA-approved, phase I clinical trials can be drastically shortened, and clinical benefit for ALL patients at risk can be further evaluated in a relative short term (5 years).Also, by studying patient T-ALL samples, we try to investigate why some patients seem to be very resistant against standard chemotherapy and try to come up with new therapeutic targets that can circumvent this chemoresistance.",

To counter the hypoxic challenge and ensure their survival, mucosal cells induce evolutionary conserved adaptive responses mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and NFkB under the control of oxygen-sensitive prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1, 2 and 3). How the oxygen sensing machinery contributes to the pathogenesis of IBD and CRC is still not fully understood and is the main focus of my research. The ultimate goal is to identifynovel therapeutic targets and treatment approachesthat could benefitIBDand/orCRCpatients.During my PhD, I studied the cell-specific contribution of PHD1 in preclinical mouse models of ileal and gut inflammation. For this, we have several immune, epithelial, fibroblast and endothelial-cell specific cre mouse lines available, enabling cell-type specific gene modulation.As a postdoc, I extended this research line by including the preclinical investigation of intestinal complications, including fibrosis and CRC. To study CRC, I established bothchemical and genetic mouse modelsthat are representative forinflammation-induced and sporadic microsatellite stable CRC. These models are used to discern discriminating signaling pathways between inflammation-dependent and -independent CRC, to test novel therapeutics or combination therapy with immunotherapy and to generate organoid and cell cultures for further in vitro mechanistic studies.",

This framework will define and categorize innovations in radiotherapy, but equally define endpoints and minimal benefit required for clinical implementation and link these with the required evidence in view of their clinical introduction in the health care system.Ultimately, adopting this value framework with policy implications will facilitate timely access to high-value radiotherapy interventions for patients.",

Asparaginase is an enzymatic drug essential in the combination chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL). This drug depletes asparagine in the blood, and the malignant lymphoid cells, that depend on extracellular asparagine, will go into apoptosis. Monitoring is essential to identify silent inactivation, and thus to guide the therapy. \u00a0In Belgium I am the contact person for lab matters on this topic.Another topic focusses on childhood cancer predisposition for the identification of (novel) oncogenes and tumor suppressors.My expertise covers divers lab techniques and bioinformatics, including spectrophotometry, ELISA, RNA and DNA analysis techniques, sequencing analysis, cell culture techniques, flow cytometry.",

Technological advancements have led to an explosion in the amount of available omics data, both at bulk and single cell level, as well as across multiple regulatory layers in the cell. The integration of these multi-omics data provides a novel and exciting approach to study complex diseases such as cancer or neuroinflammatory disorders. However, multi-omics data integration is challenging, and diverse methodologies are available. Integrated regulatory networks, which map multi-omics molecular interactions, are a means to study gene regulation mechanistically at a system level and allow to generate biological hypotheses and to identify biomarkers and novel drug targets.In my PhD, I aim to study the mechanisms of gut-brain communication through integrated regulatory networks of inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis, two archetypical examples of inflammation within their respective tissues. Specifically, I will focus on the identification of regulators (e.g. transcription factors and metabolites) and regulatory network rewiring during inflammation. In addition, I will use genome-scale metabolic modeling to study tissue specific cellular metabolism and even interactions between anatomically distant tissues. In the end, we aim to use this knowledge to functionally tweak the gut-brain axis and develop novel therapeutics, not only for multiple sclerosis but also for other neuroinflammatory disorders.",

Currently, surgical removal of the PDAC offers the only chance for a cure. After neo-adjuvant therapy, a surgeon must evaluate whether borderline resectable (BR) and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (LAPDA) patients are eligible for/benefit from surgery. However, surgical resectability is often difficult to predict as spatial changes are unreliable on CT scans and the tumor marker (CA 19-9) is not specific enough. Therefore, there is a need for new, non-invasive diagnostic techniques that can better predict surgical resectability in PDAC patients.The general aim of this study is to evaluate if a combination of clinical data and genetic profiling of liquid biopsies can successfully predict surgical resection in pancreatic cancer patients with BR or LAPDA. This would avoid unnecessary open abdomens, consequently improving the quality of life and make treatment more proficient.This project will investigate:the evolution of the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood samples from patients and subsequently phenotype the CTCs using genetic and proteomic approachesdriver mutations and epigenetic changes in cell free DNAproteomic evaluation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and tissue leakage proteins (TLPs)",

        "research_focus": "Millions of people worldwide suffer from neurological disorders, including brain tumors. Despite extensive research efforts aimed at finding cures, the treatment options remain largely inadequate. One of the major reasons for the lack of treatment options is the challenge of drug delivery to the brain which requires crossing of the tightly sealed brain barriers, including the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier at the choroid plexus (ChP). Clearly, there is an urgent need to design novel targeting methods to improve the delivery of therapeutics to the brain (tumor). Single variable domain antibodies or VHHs can be used to target specific receptors at the barriers and consequently exploit the naturally occurring transcytosis mechanisms at the barrier. Recently, the host lab identified a VHH capable of reaching the brain after peripheral injection. To assess the crossing ability of brain targeting VHHs, we currently make use of VHH-neurotensin (NT) peptide fusions. NT induces a measurable hypothermic response upon reaching the hypothalamus. Importantly, this peptide is unable to cross the brain barriers. Consequently, a drop in body temperature after peripheral injections of VHH-NT fusions demonstrates the barrier crossing capacity of the VHH. Recently, we introduced \u00a0ChP organoids to replace the in vivo experiments. These ChP organoids are derived from human pluripotent stem cells and produce a CSF-like fluid contained within a functional barrier of choroid plexus epithelial cells. We aim to employ these organoids to screen for barrier crossing VHHs and to unravel the mechanisms by which they do so.",

These migratory cells cannot be targeted by local therapy which is limited by anatomical constraints (eloquent brain).We aim to understand thecues for HGG cell migrationas HGG cell motility may provide an opportunity. By synthetically administering migratory cues, tumor cells can be misled to a location of choice and there targeted by local therapy. In short,the tumor is attracted to be killed, a principle that we named \u2018motility trapping\u2019.For this project, we closely collaborate with the research team ofProf. Robrecht Raedt(4Brain lab).",

Within MDG,NGS is used for the detection of SNVs, indels, CNVs and fusions in DNA/RNA of tumour tissue, blood or bone marrow samples of cancer patients. The presence of certain genetic defects can help to predict therapy response, can guide the diagnosis and/or can fine tune the prognosis of cancer patients with solid tumors or hematological malignancies.Even though my main focus is now in diagnostics, I\u2019m still involved in the research team of prof. dr.

Therefore, novel treatment options are of major importance.Our research focuses on a newly identified immunotherapeutic target, TARP, in adult and pediatric AML patients. Both the evaluation of cytotoxic T-cells with TARP as target and the development of a TARP-directed AML nanobody will be addressed.

Moreover,\u00a0autologous free tissue transfer in reconstructive surgery is imperfect due to\u00a0invasive harvesting of tissue and the long duration and complexity of the\u00a0operation. The biofabrication of organs is a promising strategy to diminish the\u00a0shortage of donor organs and to resolve the shortcomings in free autologous\u00a0tissue transfer.\u00a0To biofabricate large organs, the integration of vasculature is\u00a0essential.

In this research project, a vascular model for organ\u00a0engineering will be created that comprises both macro- and\u00a0microvasculature. The macrovasculature will be 3D bioprinted with a novel\u00a0vascular biomaterial consisting of a mixture between gelatin and elastin. To\u00a0form the microvascular network, angiogenesis from the macrovasculature\u00a0towards vascularized microtissues will be stimulated using biomaterial\u00a0modifications (eg. alterations in physico-chemical properties and 3D\u00a0architecture) and saRNA technology.

This challenge arises due to cancer cells infiltrating nearby tissues or forming metastases. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent contrast imaging, which is already in use in human oncology, could improve this by making cancer cells visible during surgery. This method involves using a marker that attaches to cancer cells, making them stand out from healthy cells during surgery.For a specific type of cancer known ashemangiosarcoma, this imaging could also detect metastases that are otherwise hard to find. Traditional biomarker detection methods have limitations due to the size of the molecules used. However, recent research has shown that smaller molecules likenanobodiescan be effective in human and canine cancers. They penetrate tumor tissues better and offer advantages like stability, quick clearance, ease of engineering, and low production cost, making them promising for cancer imaging and surgery.My research project is centered on identifying a specific biomarker for metastatic (splenic) hemangiosarcoma in canines. The objective is toenhance surgical results through the application of fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS).This approach is grounded in both the veterinary expertise and clinical trials conducted at the Soft Tissue Department of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Ghent University.",

L-asparaginase is already a cornerstone enzymatic drug in the treatment of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma. However, current administration is limited due to immune reactions and asparaginase-related toxicities.The second KOTK study will focus on validating the inhibition of the amino acid stress response (AAR) signalling pathway by inhibition of GCN2 in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Blocking the AAR pathway by GCN2 inhibition will result in increased sensitivity to L-asparaginase administration and induces apoptosis. For this study, we will enrol a clinical trial in cats with feline mammary adenocarcinoma. Improving treatment options for human TNBC is important, because in contrast to patients with hormone receptor- and HER2-positive breast cancers, TNBC patients have limited therapeutic options.",

Consequently, even minor disturbances in the histone profile may have significant consequences such as the development of cancer or autoimmune and neurological disorders. As a result, screening for such epigenetic changes during toxicity testing, particularly in drug development, holds considerable interest.My PhD therefore primarily focused on optimizing the workflow to investigate histone PTMs and applying it to study changes in these modifications following treatment with various drugs and compounds of abuse. These changes could serve as indicators of potential toxicity by disrupting the normal equilibrium within biological systems, potentially contributing to the onset of cancer.During my postdoctoral research, further refinements to this workflow will be accompanied by exploration into the potential of histone adductomics. Adductomics investigates the formation and presence of adducts resulting from the interaction between reactive compounds and biological molecules after exposure to xenobiotics. Currently, the focus primarily centers on DNA adducts due to their direct correlation with mutagenesis and subsequent carcinogenesis. However, my research endeavors pivot towards exploring adducts introduced onto histones. Given the critical role of histone (PTMs) in epigenetic regulation, it is hypothesized that these histone adducts may elicit undesirable responses, potentially leading to toxic effects such as cancer development. Presently, DNA adductomics already plays a significant role in elucidating the link between exposure to carcinogens and cancer onset by identifying and quantifying specific adducts formed by carcinogenic compounds. In my research, the objective is to establish histone adductomics as a means to gain valuable insights into exposure to environmental or dietary carcinogens.",

The major advantage about this biomarker is that it can be measured in various body fluids or even on tissue. Currently, we are exploring the use of N-glycosylation as diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer (collaboration with VIB-UGent [unit Nico Callewaert] and Leiden University Medical Center). The objective is to develop a test that can be implemented in routine clinical practice in the near future.Secondly, a great deal of interest is going into tumor immunology and how this tumor micro-environment can modify the response to targeted therapies, e.g. immunotherapy with check-point inhibitors. Therefore, we are conducting innovative research into describing the tumor micro-environment of various solid carcinoma (special focus on kidney cancer, head- and neck cancer and melanoma) in order to identify novel biomarkers that can have diagnostic or therapeutic potential. In this matter, we apply pathological approaches (immunohistochemistry), genetic testing (DNA and RNA sequencing) as well as protein biochemistry (e.g. haptoglobin polymorphism)."

Whenever possible, these patients are treated by tumour resection, preferably using minimal invasive robotic surgery. When the tumour is rather small, only the tumour is resected during a so-called partial nephrectomy procedure. However, when the tumour is too large or the case is too complex, the entire kidney is removed to minimize the risks for the patient during the surgery. This implicates that the patient not only loses the tumour, but also the functionality of the healthy tissue still present in the affected kidney.Our goal is to minimize this loss, by preoperatively modelling kidney perfusion. For this, we are developing state-of-the-art patient-specific treatment planning tools. This way, we want to provide all possible knowledge about the patient\u2019s case in order to guide the surgeon towards the choice for a partial nephrectomy procedure, without compromising on the safety for the patient.",

In other words, it is vital for personalized cancer treatment. We develop analytical methods for the quantification of these drugs in regular plasma and in alternative samples, such as dried blood microsamples which enable (home) sampling by the patients themselves. Measured concentrations are correlated with clinical status of the patient, molecular response, presence of adverse effects,\u2026 The methods can also be used in clinical routine practice.",

The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the beginning of the previous decade has provided a promising new class of therapeutics to treat TNBC. However, for ICIs to work effectively, it is key that the patient must have reactive T-cells present in the tumor micro environment (TME). In most solid cancer TMEs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) foster immunosuppression, and thereby diminish the efficacy of ICIs. Targeting TAMs and MDSCs to halt their role in tumor progression therefore presents a novel strategy to bolster ICI therapies, especially in 'cold' TMEs. Our research focusses on the development of a gene editing strategy to knock out the signal regulatory protein-alpha (SIRP-\u03b1) receptor, present on MDSCs and TAMs, in order to create long-lasting anti-tumor immune responses. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently one of the most popular and sophisticated nonviral delivery platforms and therefore seem extremely suitable for this research. However, the impact of LNP composition on its delivery mechanisms remains inadequately understood, posing a critical knowledge gap in this field.The goal of our research will therefore be to elucidate the correlation between LNP design and its resulting biodistribution and cellular tropism towards MDSCs and TAMs. We plan to employ a DNA-barcoding and sequencing-based methodology to precisely elucidate these associations. This knowledge will then be used for in situ CRISPR-mediated silencing of SIRP-\u03b1 in myeloid cells in a syngeneic orthotopic TNB cancer model. We will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, with and without concurrent anti-PD-1 treatment.",

Together with colleagues from the Dept. of Nuclear Medicine, Dept. of Head and Neck Surgery and Dept. of Pathology, we focus on a subgroup of patients with persisting disease for whom classical follow-up imaging modalities, but also classical adjuvant treatments are no longer applicable. In these patients, due to a dedifferentiation process, thyroid carcinomas are no longer capable of efficiently taking up iodine \u2013 making both I-123 surveillance scans as well as I-131 therapy useless. These thyroid carcinomas are then considered to be iodine-refractory and this is associated with worse outcomes. Currently available imaging modalities used in other oncologic settings (FDG-PET, CT, MRI) are largely non-specific, as are available anti-tumor treatments for these patients (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, tyrosin kinase inhibitors, \u2026).Using a more novel tracer, ie. 18F-PSMA-11 which is already in clinical use in patients with prostate cancer, we hope to be able to better identify localizations of persistent disease in patients with iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma. In addition, we aim to explore the value of serum PSMA levels as a novel tumor marker as well as underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of aberrant PSMA expression in thyroid carcinoma. Importantly, Lu177-PSMA is used as an adjunctive therapy in patients with metastasized prostate cancers. If we would find high enough PSMA uptake in patients with iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma, this might open the way for a new treatment option in these patients in need.",

Although in vivo evidence for causal relationships are still lacking, exposure to these mycotoxins is hypothesized to have a profound impact on the intestinal morphology by compromising the epithelial barrier and genomic integrity of intestinal epithelial cells, but also on the gut microbiome composition, hereby promoting the initiation and development of CRC.My research aims to map the phenotypic and molecular effects of single as well as combined mycotoxin exposure on tumorigenesis and on the gut microbiome. In WP2, we aim to explore the relevance of the mycotoxins, in human CRC/CAC. I will work with human intestinal organoids and subsequently, the preclinically identified tumour-promoting signalling pathways will be validated in CRC/CAC samples. The results will form a basis for future strategies for early detection of human cancer, and prevention by identification of risks related to mycotoxins exposure.",

The foremost toxic effects of mycotoxins are carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, oestrogenicity, allergenic manifestations, reproductive disorders, immunosuppression, and dermal effects. research studying the relationship between nutrition (= dietary exposure) and cancer needs to be prioritized and extended substantially. The notion that multiple mycotoxin exposure has a potentially increased carcinogenic effect, over singularly present mycotoxins, is resonated in more recent publications. Mycotoxins may affect three distinct stages in the carcinogenic process, namely the initiation, promotion, and progression phases of cancer aetiology. Although several cancers might be associated with multiple mycotoxin exposure (e.g. liver, colon, rectum, kidney, oesophagus, breast, etc.), empirical evidence remains scarce or non-existent for most of these types of cancer. Moreover, multiple mycotoxin exposures and cancer incidence have never been investigated for causal relationships through a genomic-approach.",

MYCN amplification is a hallmark of high-risk NB while ALK mutations occur in all risk groups with increased frequency in relapsed cases. Despite the application of multimodal therapies, progress in survival for high-risk NB patients has been modest in the past decades underlining the urgent need for \u00a0novel, more efficient and less toxic therapies. Recently, combination drugging with focus on RRM2/CHK1 inhibition has come to the forefront of targeted NB therapies. Ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2) is the rate-limiting subunit of ribonucleotide reductase involved in the conversion of ribonucleotides in deoxyribonucleotides. RRM2 plays a crucial role in DNA replication stress control and has been identified as an important NB dependency gene. In my project, full molecular and cellular landscaping of the tumor microenvironment of an immunocompetent MYCN driven NB mouse model will be carried out. Through the use of sc-RNAseq and (spatial) proteomics/transcriptomics, the effects of RRM2/CHK1 inhibition on the NB immune landscape will be evaluated and preclinical testing will be expanded.",

The lack of a clear role definition, the (positive or negative) team climate in interprofessional teams and (the lack of) coaching and direction, are influencing factors in the implementation of their roles. Both in the interprofessional team and in the broader organization, there is a need for mentoring of the ONN and CNS in oncology/hematology.Together with several partners, we will develop a Flemish mentoring program for the ONN and CNS in oncology and hematology. This mentoring program focuses not only on developing and integrating their roles and responsibilities, but it also wants to involve other interprofessional team members such as physicians, nursing staff, oncopsychologists, and executives such as healthcare managers and head nurses. In this way, we hope to familiarize each interprofessional team member and manager with the roles of an ONN and/or CNS and with what their added value can be to the interprofessional team.",

These peptide hydrogels are safe, biodegradable, easy to prepare and, importantly, injectable. The hydrogel systems afford the controlled-release of the therapeutic cargos, making it possible to reduce frequency of injection and give longer-lasting effect.

In our research, we will employ systematic approaches to unveil the biological processes regulated by hundreds of lncRNA in human cells under different conditions. This will provide new fundamental insights into the characteristics of functional lncRNA and involve the development of predictive models, enabling better classification and prioritization of candidate lncRNA molecules for in-depth experimental research.",

Due to these alterations, they can escape the immune system, escape apoptotic signals, circulate freely throughout the body which results in metastasis, and many more. The positive side of this altered glycosylation is that it makes cancer cells different from healthy cells, making the altered glycans a possible target forimmunotherapy.The ultimate goal of this project is to find and localize specific altered glycans on tumor cells. In this way, antibodies can be developed that recognize both the cancer-specific glycan and amino acid backbone of the protein on which it resides. These combinatory epitopes are called glycopeptide epitopes. There are not many tumor specific epitopes known for solid tumors, so these glycopeptide epitopes could be new, very potent targets for immunotherapeutics.With this project, we want to develop amass spectrometrybased technique that allows us to localize, identify and quantify specific cancer-related glycans on their plasma membrane proteins in one single run. The current state of the art mass spectrometry based glycan analytics allow only for localization OR identification, but never the combination of both. We hope to overcome this bottleneck with this project, in order to find the promising glycopeptide epitopes.",

In the last years it has become clear that germline mutations in a large number of different genes are predispose to familial pancreatic cancer.In current clinical practice, tumor biopsy is the most used method for categorizing pancreatic tumors for clinical decisions. Because of the risks and limitations related to this invasive procedure, a test to detect pancreatic cancer in an early stage is needed. An attractive minimally invasive procedure is now emerging based on the concept of liquid biopsies. In the blood of patients with cancer, circulating cell-free nucleic acids such as DNA, mRNA and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) have been discovered.The major aim of my project is\u00a0to gain insight in the genetic basis of patients with a presumed genetic predisposition for pancreatic cancer.",

The processes we focus on are those of (cancer) drug molecules that reach a target, such as a protein binding site or the interior of a cell, where we usually want to compute the drug residence time or the permeation rate constant.A significant challenge of these processes is the vast difference between timescales, which makes our computational experiments extremely demanding. My simulations are therefore based on the path sampling methodology, as it makes use of Metropolis Monte Carlo sampling in path space to discover and analyze rare events in these complex biological systems. Moreover, path sampling allows studying the exact kinetics of the processes we are simulating.The central goal of my research is further developing the path sampling methodology to evaluate the kinetics and efficacy of certain drug molecules using molecular dynamics simulations and contribute to the field of (cancer) drug discovery in this way.",

However, many patients show little or no benefit to these checkpoint inhibitors, emphasizing the need for other treatments that stimulate the immune system. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a phenomenon in which cancer cell death results in activation of adaptive anti-tumor immunity. The emergence of the concept of ICD has opened the avenue for development of novel anti-cancer strategies. Half of the patients worldwide receive X-ray radiotherapy (XRT) throughout the course of their treatment. It has become clear that an indispensable component of XRT\u2019s curative potential is its activation of the immune system. We and others found that XRT is associated with iron-dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO), a feature of ferroptosis. Furthermore, we recently found that LPO or associated processes correlate with reduced capacity of dendritic cells to support antigen presentation. In this project, we aim at better understanding the underlying signaling pathways determining the fate of cells following XRT at different doses, how these cellular outcomes, more precisely lipid peroxidation and associated metabolites, determine the immunogenicity, and how this could be modulated to improve the anticancer immunogenic response during XRT in experimental cancer models resulting in a more efficient abscopal effect.",

While different treatment options exist, including surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the rapid disease progression demands more effective and targeted strategies. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer an attractive option for delivering chemotherapeutics and other relevant effector molecules to the tumor site, thanks to their tumor-homing capacity.The common requirement for using MSCs as drug delivery carriers to treat glioblastoma is a technology that can efficiently and gently load MSCs with the relevant effector molecules before being transferred into the patient. One of the most notable and promising examples in recent years is \u2018photoporation\u2019, which was originally developed in the lab ofProf. Kevin Braeckmans. In photoporation, photothermal nanoparticles (NPs) are first added to cells in culture along with the cargo molecules. When exposed to short (<10 ns) and intense laser pulses at higher energy, the temperature of the photothermal NPs rapidly rise and exceed the critical temperature of water, resulting in the formation of water vapor nanobubbles (VNBs). The rapid expansion and collapse of these VNBs generate pressure waves that mechanically form pores into the plasma membrane.During her postdoctoral fellowship, Wenjia will use photoporation to load MSCs with therapeutically relevant molecules for treating glioblastoma with drug-loaded MSCs, as well as their extracellular vesicles. This will support the development of MSC-related anticancer strategies.",

The short duration (90 minutes) of intraperitoneal chemotherapy during HIPEC and the immunosuppressive effects of the combined surgery and chemotherapy significantly limit its effectiveness.During my PhD, our goal is to address the limitations of current colorectal PM treatments by using a biocompatible prolonged-release formulation to extend drug exposure and combining TLR agonists with cytotoxic therapy to boost the immune response. We will explore these innovative treatments for colorectal PM through locoregional (intraperitoneal) immune modulation. To efficiently study our hypothesis, we will establish a syngeneic CRC PM mouse model. We aim to demonstrate that this dual approach could reduce the chances of locoregional and systemic recurrence.",

The abnormal methylation profile is an early event in tumorigenesis, specific to the tissue-of-origin and more consistent within cancer subtypes compared to mutations. Last but not least abnormal methylation patterns of tumor cells are also retained in the circulating DNA unlocking the potential of non invasive diagnostics through liquid biopsies. Despite the great promise that DNA methylation holds as a biomarker, it has not yet been widely implemented in the clinical practice, due to limitations in the analytical measurement methods. The Callewaert group with Dr Andries De Koker as a project leader has managed to develop a cost-effective methylome profiling method (termed \u2018cfRRBS\u2019) suitable to be performed in liquid biopsies. However, detection of the tumor methylation signature in liquid biopsies can prove challenging especially in cases of low tumor load due to high noise originating from cell free DNA of non tumour cells.My research focuses on further development of cfRRBS by exploring innovative ways to enrich the cancer signal which will expand the application potential of cfRRBS including monitoring drug response and early relapse. In parrarel I aim to highlight the potential of cfRRBS as a biomarker discovery platform by setting up clinical studies (eg DNA methylation biomarkers related to drug response in DLBCL and early detection of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis).",

Despite intensive therapies being administered, often resulting in side effects such as leukemia, cardiomyopathies, and hearing loss, around 50% of children with a high-risk clinical phenotype eventually succumb to the disease.\u00a0The reason of the poor outcome of existing therapies is to be found in the cellular heterogeneity of the tumor, containing cell types that are not targeted properly in the therapy. Some of these cell types represent a reservoir for tumor cells when selective pressure is applied by treatment.\u00a0The spectrum of cell types underlies different regulatory programs, ending up in a variety of expression profiles, often referred to as cell states.\u00a0In this context, gene regulatory networks highlight interactions between biomolecules, potentially revealing the intricate relationships between regulators each tumor cell relies on.Gene regulatory networks can be inferred from a variety of omics data.\u00a0In particular, single cell RNA sequencing has proved to be extremely valuable for the inference of gene regulatory networks, while other omics data types e.g. epigenomics data, significantly can enhance the accuracy of the inferred networks.\u00a0By leveraging such information, my research aims at elucidating the heterogeneity across patients and disease stages, both from a cell type point of view and from a regulatory point of view, in order to identify novel candidates to be targeted within future personalized treatments.",

        "research_focus": "Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and malignant glial tumor of the central nervous system. Despite standard medical treatment that consists of surgical resection, radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, GB is associated with a poor prognosis. Hence, there is an urgent need for novel effective therapies that act on GB to improve survival outcomes.Based on recent evidence suggesting that transmembrane connexin (Cx) proteins may be causally involved in the pathogenesis of GB, a therapeutic strategy directed against Cx-mediated communication might be promising for the treatment of GB. Particularly Cx43, the most ubiquitous and well-studied Cx, has been highlighted to play an essential role in the microenvironment of GB. Cx43 has been indicated as an operator of tumor invasion, an indicator of tumor progression, and an inducer of TMZ resistance in GB cells by several studies.The crucial function of Cx43 in GB progression/invasion and therapeutic resistance motivated our research group to investigate whether targeting of Cx43-mediated communication by using a pharmacological inhibitor such as tonabersat might provide new and potent ways to improve the standard medical treatment of GB.Our group previously confirmed the therapeutic effect of tonabersat in combination to RT (1 dose of 20 Gy) and TMZ chemotherapy in the F98 GB rat model. The next step is to optimize the treatment protocol and to evaluate the most potent combination of fractionated RT, TMZ chemotherapy and/or tonabersat using animal models that allow follow-up with preclinical MRI. Finally, the most optimal administration schedule of tonabersat is investigated.",
