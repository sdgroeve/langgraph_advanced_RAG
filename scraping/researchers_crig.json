          "title": "β-actin in neutral crest cell migration and brain development",
          "description": "The mouse genome consists of six functional actin genes of which the expression patterns are temporally and spatially regulated during development and in the adult organism. Deletion of beta-actin in mouse is lethal during embryonic development, although there is compensatory expression of other actin isoforms. This suggests different isoform specific functions and, more in particular, an important function for beta-actin during early mammalian development. We here report a role for beta-actin during neural crest ontogeny. Although beta-actin null neural crest cells show expression of neural crest markers, less cells delaminate and their migration arrests shortly after. These phenotypes were associated with elevated apoptosis levels in neural crest cells, whereas proliferation levels were unchanged. Specifically the pre-migratory neural crest cells displayed higher levels of apoptosis, suggesting increased apoptosis in the neural tube accounts for the decreased amount of migrating neural crest cells seen in the beta-actin null embryos. These cells additionally displayed a lack of membrane bound N-cadherin and dramatic decrease in cadherin-11 expression which was more pronounced in the pre-migratory neural crest population, potentially indicating linkage between the cadherin-11 expression and apoptosis. By inhibiting ROCK ex vivo, the knockout neural crest cells regained migratory capacity and cadherin-11 expression was upregulated. We conclude that the presence of beta-actin is vital for survival, specifically of pre-migratory neural crest cells, their proper emigration from the neural tube and their subsequent migration. Furthermore, the absence of beta-actin affects cadherin-11 and N-cadherin function, which could partly be alleviated by ROCK inhibition, situating the Rho-ROCK signaling in a feedback loop with cadherin-11."

          "title": "Beta-actin mediated regulation of cell migration in embryonic development.",
          "description": "Cell migration is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that underlies the development and functioning of organisms (Tondeleir et al., 2009). Despite the differences in cell types involved, their migratory events occur by similar molecular mechanisms that rely on a functional actin cytoskeleton. The actin system is complex and there is reciprocal communication with the extracellular matrix and with other cells via various signaling pathways. Due to this complexity, our research group initiated studying the actin cytoskeleton via systems biology approaches. The model system we employ is the unique β-actin knock out (KO) mouse. One of the surprising results is that deleting β-actin not only impairs cell migration but also causes reprogramming of the expression profile of cells. Based on these recent data we formulate various hypotheses that will be addressed in this project. Genetic ablation of β-actin results in embryonic lethality at midgestation: day E10,5 (Schmerling et al., 2005). Our primary observation is the actin isoform switch or compensatory expression of other actin isoforms (mainly α-smooth muscle actin, αSMA) in the β-actin KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and embryo’s. In addition, β-actin KO MEFs display a severe migration defect and pronounced stress fiber and focal adhesion formation, caused by a feedback mechanism induced by overproduction of αSMA and involving Rho-ROCK activity. Disrupting the stress fibers with ROCK inhibitor or blebbistatin restores cell migration, indicating that cell migration can occur without β-actin and challenging the dogma in the field that β-actin is the driving force for cell migration (Lambrechts et al., in preparation). It also shows that the cell migration defect is a secondary effect of β-actin ablation, due to altered regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, quantitative proteomics and micro-array experiments indicate dramatic changes in gene expressions (1580 affected genes) between WT MEFs and β-actin KO MEFs. These observations strengthen our hypothesis that knock-out of β- actin triggers αSMA expression, leading to altered cytoskeletal organization and/or subsequent differential expression regulation."

Since the invention of the first microscopes almost 400 years ago, there has been an ongoing strive to ever see more details within organisms, tissues and cells. Based on fundamental physics from the nineteenth century, it was long thought impossible to see beyond a resolution of ~200 nm with light microscopes. However, thanks to recent advances in fluorescent labels and laser technology, it is now possible to improve this resolution by a staggering factor of 10, making ‘nanoscopy’ a reality. This Nobel Prize winning work is undoubtedly one of the most significant technological advances of the early 21st century, allowing an unprecedented view on living biological specimen almost down to the molecular level. Since this ground-breaking technology is currently not present at UGent or its surroundings, we propose to acquire a state-of-the art STED nanoscope for the benefit of our life science researchers. Broad interest in nanoscopy is evidenced by the support from a large consortium of 25 ZAP promoters from all of the 5 life science faculties. This unique instrument will be hosted and supported by the Centre for Advanced Light Microscopy, established in 2018 as one of the ‘Centres of Expertise’ of Ghent University with the ambition to support high quality life science research at UGent with state-of-the-art microscopy equipment and expertise."

Based on fundamental physics from the nineteenth century, it was long thought impossible to see beyond a resolution of ~200 nm with light microscopes. However, thanks to recent advances in fluorescent labels and laser technology, it is now possible to improve this resolution by a staggering factor of 10, making ‘nanoscopy’ a reality. This Nobel Prize winning work is undoubtedly one of the most significant technological advances of the early 21st century, allowing an unprecedented view on living biological specimen almost down to the molecular level. Since this ground-breaking technology is currently not present at UGent or its surroundings, we propose to acquire a state-of-the art STED nanoscope for the benefit of our life science researchers. Broad interest in nanoscopy is evidenced by the support from a large consortium of 25 ZAP promoters from all of the 5 life science faculties. This unique instrument will be hosted and supported by the Centre for Advanced Light Microscopy, established in 2018 as one of the ‘Centres of Expertise’ of Ghent University with the ambition to support high quality life science research at UGent with state-of-the-art microscopy equipment and expertise."

          "description": "The mouse genome consists of six functional actin genes of which the expression patterns are temporally and spatially regulated during development and in the adult organism. Deletion of beta-actin in mouse is lethal during embryonic development, although there is compensatory expression of other actin isoforms. This suggests different isoform specific functions and, more in particular, an important function for beta-actin during early mammalian development. We here report a role for beta-actin during neural crest ontogeny. Although beta-actin null neural crest cells show expression of neural crest markers, less cells delaminate and their migration arrests shortly after. These phenotypes were associated with elevated apoptosis levels in neural crest cells, whereas proliferation levels were unchanged. Specifically the pre-migratory neural crest cells displayed higher levels of apoptosis, suggesting increased apoptosis in the neural tube accounts for the decreased amount of migrating neural crest cells seen in the beta-actin null embryos. These cells additionally displayed a lack of membrane bound N-cadherin and dramatic decrease in cadherin-11 expression which was more pronounced in the pre-migratory neural crest population, potentially indicating linkage between the cadherin-11 expression and apoptosis. By inhibiting ROCK ex vivo, the knockout neural crest cells regained migratory capacity and cadherin-11 expression was upregulated. We conclude that the presence of beta-actin is vital for survival, specifically of pre-migratory neural crest cells, their proper emigration from the neural tube and their subsequent migration. Furthermore, the absence of beta-actin affects cadherin-11 and N-cadherin function, which could partly be alleviated by ROCK inhibition, situating the Rho-ROCK signaling in a feedback loop with cadherin-11."

          "title": "Beta-actin mediated regulation of cell migration in embryonic development.",
          "description": "Cell migration is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that underlies the development and functioning of organisms (Tondeleir et al., 2009). Despite the differences in cell types involved, their migratory events occur by similar molecular mechanisms that rely on a functional actin cytoskeleton. The actin system is complex and there is reciprocal communication with the extracellular matrix and with other cells via various signaling pathways. Due to this complexity, our research group initiated studying the actin cytoskeleton via systems biology approaches. The model system we employ is the unique β-actin knock out (KO) mouse. One of the surprising results is that deleting β-actin not only impairs cell migration but also causes reprogramming of the expression profile of cells. Based on these recent data we formulate various hypotheses that will be addressed in this project. Genetic ablation of β-actin results in embryonic lethality at midgestation: day E10,5 (Schmerling et al., 2005). Our primary observation is the actin isoform switch or compensatory expression of other actin isoforms (mainly α-smooth muscle actin, αSMA) in the β-actin KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and embryo’s. In addition, β-actin KO MEFs display a severe migration defect and pronounced stress fiber and focal adhesion formation, caused by a feedback mechanism induced by overproduction of αSMA and involving Rho-ROCK activity. Disrupting the stress fibers with ROCK inhibitor or blebbistatin restores cell migration, indicating that cell migration can occur without β-actin and challenging the dogma in the field that β-actin is the driving force for cell migration (Lambrechts et al., in preparation). It also shows that the cell migration defect is a secondary effect of β-actin ablation, due to altered regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, quantitative proteomics and micro-array experiments indicate dramatic changes in gene expressions (1580 affected genes) between WT MEFs and β-actin KO MEFs. These observations strengthen our hypothesis that knock-out of β- actin triggers αSMA expression, leading to altered cytoskeletal organization and/or subsequent differential expression regulation."

Over the last few years, cell migration research has benefited enormously from advances in methodology and instrumentation, allowing multiplexing and multi-parameter post-processing of cell migration analyses to become widely used. As cell migration studies have thus de facto become both a high-content as well as a high-throughput science, an urgent yet largely unmet bioinformatics need has emerged in the form of intra- and inter-lab data management solutions, standardization and dissemination infrastructure, and novel approaches and algorithms for meta-analysis."

The unique cell death inducing mechanism of these lipopeptides in which the cancer cell membrane is targeted is also investigated. As general approach to address cytotoxicity in this research line and in ongoing parallel collaborative research, we address the urgent need for standardization of specific cell-based assays and combine reductionist approaches (biochemical, molecular cell biology, microscopy, …) with systems biology approaches (proteomics, imaging analysis, bioinformatics, …)."
